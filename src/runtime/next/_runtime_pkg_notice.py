"""One-time deprecation notice for stale `spec-kitty-runtime` installs.

Implements FR-020 of mission ``shared-package-boundary-cutover-01KQ22DS``.

Detects, via :mod:`importlib.metadata`, whether the retired
``spec-kitty-runtime`` PyPI package is still installed in the operator's
environment. If it is, emits a single one-time notice on stderr pointing
at the migration runbook and the optional cleanup command. The notice is
gated by a marker file so subsequent invocations stay quiet.

The detection uses ``importlib.metadata.distribution`` which does NOT
import the package — that distinction is critical, because importing
``spec_kitty_runtime`` would re-create the dependency this mission
retires (FR-002 / C-001). ``importlib.metadata`` only inspects the
installed-distribution metadata; it never executes the package's code.

Failure modes are deliberately silent: if the marker file cannot be
written (read-only home, permissions, disk full), the operator still
gets the notice every invocation, which is non-fatal noise. The CLI
continues normally regardless.
