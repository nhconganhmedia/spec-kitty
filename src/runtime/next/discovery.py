"""Side-effect-free claim discovery for ``spec-kitty next --json``.

Issue #988 — Prior to this module, ``spec-kitty next --json`` reported
``mission_state: implement`` while emitting ``wp_id: null``, even though the
explicit ``spec-kitty agent action implement`` would have auto-claimed a
concrete WP. Operators and AI agents driving the readiness loop could not
trust ``next --json`` as the canonical "what should I do next?" signal.

This module exposes :func:`preview_claimable_wp`, the **single
implementation path** for "which WP would the next implement action claim?".
``_preview_claimable_wp_for_mission`` in
``specify_cli.cli.commands.agent.workflow`` delegates to this helper, so
spec FR-003 ("claimability discovery MUST share a single implementation
path with the explicit ``agent action implement`` claim logic, with no
divergent forking") is satisfied by construction rather than by
documented parallel forks.

Design constraints (spec FR-001..FR-003, C-001):

* The helper never mutates state. It must not be confused with the actual
  claim path; only :func:`start_implementation_status` mutates the event log.
* When ``mission_state != "implement"`` the ``next --json`` payload's wire
  shape is preserved (no new keys are added) — see ``runtime_bridge``.
* When ``wp_id`` is non-``None`` then ``selection_reason`` is ``None`` and
  vice versa (invariant I-001 from ``data-model.md``).
