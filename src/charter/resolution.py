"""Canonical repo root resolution via ``git rev-parse --git-common-dir``.

Contract: ``kitty-specs/unified-charter-bundle-chokepoint-01KP5Q2G/contracts/canonical-root-resolver.contract.md``

Key invariant: ``git rev-parse --git-common-dir`` stdout is CWD-relative in
the common case (e.g. ``.git`` or ``../../.git``). It is absolute only for
linked worktrees. Callers MUST resolve the returned path against ``cwd``.

This module is the sole canonical-root authority for the unified charter
bundle chokepoint (FR-003, FR-006, NFR-003). It raises loudly per C-001 — no
fallback handlers, no silent degradation.

In addition, this module is the charter-layer facade for resolution-tier
types from ``charter.offering.resolver`` (``ResolutionResult``, ``ResolutionTier``).
The runtime → charter → doctrine boundary (ADR 2026-03-27-1, tightened by
mission ``charter-mediated-doctrine-selection-01KRTZCA``) requires runtime
modules under ``src/specify_cli/`` to reach doctrine artifacts only through
charter facades. ``ResolutionResult`` and ``ResolutionTier`` are re-exported
here as **pure re-exports** (object identity preserved). No behaviour, no
wrappers, no type aliases.

    """Resolve ``path`` to the canonical (main-checkout) project root.

    See ``contracts/canonical-root-resolver.contract.md`` for the full
    behavioral matrix and error surface. The function performs at most one
    ``git rev-parse --git-common-dir`` invocation per cold call and zero on
    warm (LRU-cached) calls.

    The probe itself is delegated to the unified
    :func:`kernel.git_topology.git_common_dir` primitive (mission
    write-path-integrity-01KZZD69 WP01, #3373); this facade preserves the
    repo-**root** return shape (the parent of the common dir), the cache, and
    the historical error surface by mapping the primitive's typed errors onto
    :class:`NotInsideRepositoryError` / :class:`GitCommonDirUnavailableError`.

    Args:
        path: Any path (file or directory). May be absolute or relative. File
            inputs are normalized to their parent directory before invocation.

    Returns:
        Absolute path to the canonical project root (the main checkout).

    Raises:

            inside a ``.git/`` directory.
        GitCommonDirUnavailableError: ``git`` binary missing or
