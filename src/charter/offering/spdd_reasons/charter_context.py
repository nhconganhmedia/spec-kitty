"""SPDD/REASONS charter-context guidance renderer.

Appends the action-scoped "SPDD/REASONS Guidance" subsection to the charter
context lines list. The action scoping follows FR-009 / contracts/charter-
context.md:

| action     | canvas content surfaced                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| specify    | Requirements, Entities                             |
| plan       | Approach, Structure                                |
| tasks      | Operations, WP boundaries                          |
| implement  | Full canvas (R, E, A, S, O, N, S)                  |
| review     | Comparison surface (R, O, N, S)                    |

Activation is decided by ``is_spdd_reasons_active(repo_root)``. This helper
itself does NOT re-check activation — the caller in ``charter.activation.context`` owns
that gate (single source of truth, C-002).
