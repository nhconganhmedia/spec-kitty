"""Glossary pack domain model (FR-005, C-004).

Defines ``GlossaryTerm`` (a single canonical-term entity) and ``GlossaryPack``
(the aggregate root distributed as one ``*.glossary-pack.yaml`` file). The
term schema carries **every field the migration seed carries** — including
``see_also``, ``introduced_in_mission``, and ``synonyms_to_avoid`` beyond the
four obvious fields — so the Mission A migration off
``.kittify/glossaries/spec_kitty_core.yaml`` is provably zero-loss. The
``aliases`` / ``banned_synonyms`` enforcement fields are carried and
round-tripped for Mission B forward-compat but are inert (unwired) in
Mission A; see ``contracts/pack-schema.md`` §6.

No pack content and no gate wiring live here (WP03/WP04 own those).
