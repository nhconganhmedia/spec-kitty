"""Per-channel reachability over the DRG, computed by *calling* the canonical
traversal primitives — never by a reimplemented walk.

There are two delivery channels (contract ``activation-delivery.md`` §3), each
with its own traversal and its own reachable set:

* **action channel** — :func:`action_channel_reachable` *calls*
  :func:`charter.offering.drg.query.resolve_context` for each action seed and unions the
  results. ``resolve_context`` owns the ``scope`` → ``requires`` → ``suggests``
  algorithm; this module never re-derives it. Every hand-rolled BFS in this
  mission's history produced a *different* wrong number (91 / 88 / 78 / 59 /
  103), which is exactly why R-1 forbids reimplementing the walk.

* **profile channel** — :func:`profile_channel_reachable` is a *distinct*
  :func:`charter.offering.drg.query.walk_edges` traversal over
  ``{requires, specializes_from, suggests}`` seeded from activated agent
  profiles. It is **not** a ``resolve_context`` seed set (R-3): ``agent_profile``
  nodes carry outbound ``requires``, ``specializes_from`` and ``suggests`` edges
  but **zero** outbound ``scope``, so ``resolve_context`` — whose step 1 walks
  ``scope`` only — returns nothing from a profile seed at any depth. Folding the
  profile channel into ``resolve_context`` would silently measure zero: the
  distinguishing fact is the *absence of* ``scope``, not the presence of
  ``suggests`` (both channels now follow ``suggests``, but only ``resolve_context``
  gates it behind a ``scope``-seeded first hop that profiles never satisfy).
  ``suggests`` joins this set in mission ``doctrine-delivery-activation-01KYQVQK``
  (WP01/FR-001), animating the #3063 A–E families that PR #3070 authored inert.

Both helpers return the reachable *artefact* URNs (the seed nodes themselves are
excluded), so a caller can compute ``activated − reachable`` for the
``activated-but-unreachable`` named sets the gate pins.
