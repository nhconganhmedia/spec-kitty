"""Render the ``Action-Critical Charter Sections (<action>):`` block (FR-001).

For each action-critical charter heading, the renderer either:

* emits the **verbatim body** of the heading sliced from ``charter.md``
  (when the charter carries that section), or
* emits a **fetch + when-doing stanza** (selector ``section:<slug>``)
  when the charter is missing that section.

The two-arm contract pins the prompt-governance ATDD anchors in
``tests/specify_cli/next/test_wp_prompt_governance_contract.py``:

* ``test_implement_prompt_regression_vigilance_body_or_fetch_with_when_doing_rule``
* ``test_implement_prompt_terminology_canon_body_or_fetch_with_when_doing_rule``

The when-doing copy for each section MUST match the contract in
``kitty-specs/wp-prompt-governance-payload-01KRR8HS/contracts/charter-context-resolver.md``
verbatim — drift here is a contract violation (R-3 from the WP04 task).
