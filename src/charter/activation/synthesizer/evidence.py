"""Evidence bundle dataclasses for Phase 3 charter synthesis.

These frozen dataclasses transport structured evidence inputs (code signals,
URL lists, corpus snapshots) into the synthesis pipeline without modifying
the adapter interface.  Only ``EvidenceBundle`` is attached to
``SynthesisRequest``; all other types are nested inside it.

Timestamps (``detected_at``, ``loaded_at``, ``collected_at``) are excluded
from hash computation so that re-collecting the same evidence at different
times produces identical fixture hashes.

See data-model.md §E-5 for authoritative field documentation.
