"""Shared DoctrineService project-root candidate resolution.

Both ``src/charter/activation/compiler.py::_default_doctrine_service`` and
``src/charter/activation/context.py::_build_doctrine_service`` use the same candidate-list
ordering.  This module is the **single source of truth** for that ordering so
the two call-sites cannot drift apart.

Candidate ordering (FR-009 / T024 / T025):

1. ``.kittify/doctrine/``   — Phase 3 synthesis target; present only after a
                              successful ``spec-kitty charter synthesize`` run.
2. ``src/charter/offering/``        — code-local built-in-layer path (legacy 3.x default).
3. ``doctrine/``            — flat built-in-layer fallback.

Discovery is **conditional on directory presence**: if ``.kittify/doctrine/``
does not exist the resolver returns the next matching candidate, preserving
byte-identical behaviour for legacy (pre-synthesis) projects (R-2 mitigation).

    layer only — identical to the pre-Phase-3 default).

    The function is intentionally a thin directory-presence check: it does
    **not** inspect the directory's contents.  An empty ``.kittify/doctrine/``
    directory is still a valid candidate (the ``DoctrineService`` will simply
    surface an empty project layer with no built-in-layer impact).

        repo_root: Absolute path to the repository root.
