"""Canonical ``ast`` primitives for imports, re-exports, and ``__all__``.

This module is the single source of truth for a family of low-level
predicates that were previously hand-rolled as three independent copies:

* ``tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py`` — ``_resolve_import_from``
  and ``_extract_all_literal``.
* ``tests/architectural/test_no_dead_modules.py`` — ``_resolve_import_from``.
* ``src/specify_cli/post_merge/stale_assertions.py`` — the module-head
  re-export detector (``_import_binds_name`` / ``_dunder_all_contains_name``).

The three copies had **deliberately different semantics** for their
respective jobs. This module preserves each behavior exactly rather than
"unifying" them into one lossy predicate — the divergences are documented
inline so a future reader sees they are intentional, not accidental:

* ``module_of_import_from`` — byte-identical resolver shared by both
  architectural gates (dead-symbols and dead-modules).
* ``extract_static_all`` — the dead-symbols gate's whole-module ``__all__``
  reader: returns the full static set, distinguishes *dynamic* (``None``)
  from *absent-value* (empty ``frozenset``), is ``AnnAssign``-aware, and
  accepts only list/tuple literals.
* ``import_binds_name`` / ``assignment_lists_dunder_all`` — the
  stale-assertion analyzer's per-node membership predicates: they answer
  "does *this* statement bind/export *this* name?", accept ``__all__``
  expressed as a set literal too, and are **not** ``AnnAssign``-aware.

The last two ``__all__`` helpers intentionally differ from
``extract_static_all`` (set-literal handling, ``AnnAssign`` handling); they
answer a different question and must not be collapsed together.

    Returns ``None`` if the module does not declare ``__all__`` OR
    declares it dynamically (e.g. ``__all__ = sorted(...)``). Dynamic
    declarations are legal but cannot be statically introspected for
    membership and are therefore skipped by callers that walk membership.

    Accepts both ``ast.Assign`` and ``ast.AnnAssign`` — typed
    declarations like ``__all__: list[str] = []`` are equivalent for the
    purposes of this walker. Only list/tuple literals are accepted as a
    static value; anything else (including a set literal) yields ``None``.

    An ``AnnAssign`` without a value (``__all__: list[str]``) is treated as
    dynamic/absent membership and returns an empty ``frozenset`` — distinct
    from ``None``, which means "not statically introspectable".

    NOTE: this deliberately differs from ``assignment_lists_dunder_all``,
    which is a per-node membership predicate accepting set literals and
    ignoring ``AnnAssign``. The two answer different questions; do not
