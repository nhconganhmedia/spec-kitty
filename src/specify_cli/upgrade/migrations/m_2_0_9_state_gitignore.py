"""Migration: add NEW runtime state surfaces to .gitignore.

Adds the 5 runtime gitignore entries introduced by this sprint to existing
projects.  Existing entries (.dashboard, workspaces/, charter/*,
missions/__pycache__/) are already present in projects that were initialized
before this migration -- they are NOT re-added here.

Per constraint C-001, charter surfaces are explicitly excluded from
this migration's scope.
