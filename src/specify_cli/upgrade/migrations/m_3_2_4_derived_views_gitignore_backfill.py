"""Migration: backfill ``.kittify/derived/`` gitignore coverage (#2369, Defect B).

``spec-kitty materialize`` writes regenerable machine-facing views (lifecycle /
board-summary / progress JSON) under ``.kittify/derived/<slug>/``. That surface
is registered as an ``IGNORED`` state surface (``derived_mission_views`` in
``state/contract.py``), so a fresh ``spec-kitty init`` emits ``.kittify/derived/``
into ``.gitignore`` via the full runtime entry set.

Existing projects, however, only receive gitignore repairs through the
per-entry runtime-hygiene migrations, none of which knew about
``.kittify/derived/``. So an already-initialised project that runs
``materialize`` (e.g. an orchestrator-completed mission) had the derived views
show up as untracked, dirtying the tree and failing ``spec-kitty accept``'s
``git_dirty`` check.

This backfill repairs that: it adds ``.kittify/derived/`` to ``.gitignore`` for
projects that lack it. Following the ``3.2.3_encoding_provenance`` precedent,
the entry is **hardcoded here** rather than sourced from the live contract so
the migration's behaviour is frozen and deterministic regardless of future
contract changes.
