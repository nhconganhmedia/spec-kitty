"""Migration ``normalize_activation_absence``: absent ``activated_<kind>`` -> explicit ``[]``.

Contract: ``kitty-specs/doctrine-delivery-reachability-01KYMXD6/contracts/
activation-delivery.md`` §1 (V-3), spec FR-018. This is WP07/T037.

FR-018 retires the three-state absence contract at the delivery boundary: an
*omitted* per-artifact ``activated_<kind>`` key used to mean "all built-ins
available", which is a fail-open — once delivery works, a project that never
activated procedures would silently receive all of them. This migration writes
an explicit empty list for every per-artifact activation key that is absent from
the project's *resolved* activation store, so absence becomes ``[]`` (nothing
activated) rather than "everything". It also ensures the ``.kittify/config.yaml``
``charter:`` pointer is present when a ``charter.yaml`` store exists.

Scope (NFR-001 — bounded consumer mutation): the ONLY consumer file this
migration writes is the charter/config activation surface, and only to normalize
absence. It never touches ``activated_kinds`` or ``mission_type_activations``
(coarser gates whose absence semantics are owned elsewhere — note that
``mission_type_activations`` no longer carries a built-in default: mission
resolution-activation-foundation-01KZ9FKG WP04 retired that implicit default and
made an absent key fail closed, so this migration deliberately leaves that key
to the create/use boundary rather than normalizing it here), never removes an
explicit ``[]`` or a populated list, and installs nothing.

Reconciliation of the two prior migrations (WP07/T041)
------------------------------------------------------
Two migrations already fought over this surface, in opposite directions, and the
config-embedded ``activated_*`` mirror survived both:

1. ``m_unify_charter_activation.py`` (``target_version = "3.2.6rc1"``) made
   ``config.activated_<kind>`` the single activation authority — it *wrote*
   activation INTO ``config.yaml``.
2. ``m_unify_charter_activation_finalize.py``
   (``consolidate_charter_bundle_fold``, ``target_version = "3.2.6rc1"``) reversed
   that: it folded activation into a git-tracked ``charter.yaml`` and minted the
   ``config.yaml`` ``charter:`` pointer, then stripped the ``activated_*`` keys
   from ``config.yaml``.

Why the finalize pass did not take (the mirror is still present on checkouts):

* **Deliberate absence preservation.** The finalize migration copies activation
  VERBATIM and *explicitly refuses to invent* ``[]`` for an absent key
  (``_compose_charter_yaml_document``: "an absent key stays absent ... never
  invented as ``[]``, which would flip 'all built-ins active' to 'none active',
  MG1 / SC-008"). Under the THEN-current three-state contract that was correct.
  FR-018 REVERSES that contract, so absence was never normalized — this
  migration is the reversal.
* **Same-version gating.** ``MigrationRegistry.get_applicable`` includes a
  migration only when ``from_version < target_version <= to_version``, or when
  ``target_version == from_version`` *and* ``detect()`` is true on an explicit
  upgrade run. A project already stamped at the finalize migration's own
  ``3.2.6rc1`` target (e.g. via the seed migration that shares that version, or via
  hand-authored dogfood config) reaches ``3.2.6`` with no ``from < to`` window,
  so the mirror-removal (``_rewrite_config``) only fires if an upgrade is
  explicitly invoked at that exact version. That timing gap left a
  hand-/seed-maintained ``config.yaml`` ``activated_*`` mirror co-existing with
  ``charter.yaml``'s copy.

FR-017 is therefore the third pass: rather than rely on a version-gated fold that
can silently no-op on a same-version project, it repoints the in-code reader onto
the resolved authority (T035) and removes the mirror directly (T036); this
migration (T037/FR-018) then normalizes absence in the resolved store.

**Ordering constraint** (declared, mirroring the finalize migration's own
docstring): this migration is safe to run in any order relative to the finalize
fold because it operates on the *resolved* store — ``charter.yaml`` when the
``charter:`` pointer is present, else the legacy ``config.yaml``. It is idempotent
(MG2): once every per-artifact key is explicit, ``detect()``/``apply()`` report a
clean no-op.

Body pattern mirrors ``m_unify_charter_activation_finalize.py``. Registered via
``@MigrationRegistry.register``; ``runs_on_worktrees = False`` (a
project-identity/config-level normalization, not a worktree concern).
``charter.*`` imports are lazy inside the methods so registry discovery stays
import-cheap (C-002).

Two-invocation churn guard (NFR-006, landing-fold fix for #3070)
------------------------------------------------------------------
``MigrationRegistry.get_applicable`` builds a SAME-VERSION (``target ==
from_version``) migration's inclusion in the applicable list from
``detect()`` evaluated ONCE, against the project's state *before any
migration in this same upgrade invocation has run*. That means a
same-version migration whose applicability only becomes true as a
*consequence* of an earlier same-version migration's write is not picked up
until the *next* ``spec-kitty upgrade`` call.

On a project whose ``config.yaml`` carries **zero** activation keys and no
``charter.yaml`` yet (the common freshly-``init``-ed shape, before a charter
interview ever runs), this migration is that earlier write: writing all nine
explicit ``[]`` per-artifact keys directly into ``config.yaml`` makes
``m_unify_charter_activation_finalize.ConsolidateCharterBundleMigration``'s
own ``_config_has_activation`` trigger true — but one invocation too late,
so a fold that should have happened alongside this normalization instead
lands on the *second* ``upgrade --yes`` call, breaking "a second consecutive
upgrade changes zero bytes" (NFR-006).

``_should_defer_bare_config_write`` closes this gap: when config.yaml is the
resolved store (no ``charter.yaml`` yet) and nothing else already visible
this pass would trigger the fold anyway (no legacy bundle, no existing
config-embedded activation, no pending answers-only promotion), writing the
normalized ``[]`` values here would be the SOLE, premature trigger — so the
write is deferred entirely rather than split across two invocations. Nothing
is lost by deferring: FR-017 already repoints the runtime activation reader
onto "absence means nothing activated," so an un-materialized absent key
reads identically to an explicit ``[]``; the values get materialized once
there is real activation data (or a legacy bundle / ``charter generate``)
for the fold to relocate. When something else already arms the fold this
pass, the write proceeds immediately so the fold's live per-item ``detect()``
picks it up in the SAME invocation (single-pass convergence, matching how a
genuinely-old project's rc35 seed migrations already converge in one pass).
