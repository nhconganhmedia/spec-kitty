"""Migration: expand glossary-context skill with pipeline architecture documentation.

The original skill only covered curation (inspect, update, resolve). This adds
the full 5-layer middleware pipeline explanation, term extraction methods,
checkpoint/resume mechanism, step-level configuration, integration patterns,
and all 8 event types — everything an agent needs to understand how the glossary
actually runs during mission execution.

Uses the reusable skill_update utility to find and replace skill files across
all agent skill roots.
