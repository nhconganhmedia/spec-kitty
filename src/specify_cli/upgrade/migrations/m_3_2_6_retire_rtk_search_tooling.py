"""Migration m_3_2_6_retire_rtk_search_tooling: drop a retired toolguide activation.

Operator ruling 2026-07-28 removed the ``rtk-search-tooling`` toolguide outright:
the artefact, its guide, its DRG node, and its entry in the shipped default
charter pack (``src/charter/activation/packs/default.yaml``) are all gone. RTK will not be
pushed to the userbase.

Why a migration is required
---------------------------
``m_3_2_0rc35_default_charter_pack`` copied the default pack's
``activated_toolguides`` **verbatim** into every upgraded project's
``.kittify/config.yaml``, and — by design — writes only *absent* keys. A later
upgrade therefore never removes a stale member from an already-present key. So
every project that passed through rc35 still names ``rtk-search-tooling`` in
``activated_toolguides`` while the artefact no longer exists on disk.

The charter compiler is deliberately fail-closed: ``charter.activation.compiler`` raises
:class:`charter.activation.kind_vocabulary.UnknownArtifactIdError` rather than silently
dropping an unresolvable stem, and that raise is not caught on the compile
path. The observed consequence is a hard failure::

    UnknownArtifactIdError: No toolguide artifact with config ID
    'rtk-search-tooling' found under doctrine root src/doctrine.

This migration is the unmanaged-retirement backstop: it removes the stale
activation from ``config.yaml`` and also strips the two compiled blocks in
``.kittify/charter/`` (``charter.yaml`` and ``references.yaml``) that would
otherwise be left naming a deleted ``source_path``.

Scope
-----
Three project files, each optional:

* ``.kittify/config.yaml``            — ``activated_toolguides`` list member
* ``.kittify/charter/charter.yaml``   — ``catalog`` reference block + ``activated_toolguides`` member
* ``.kittify/charter/references.yaml``— ``references`` reference block

Nothing is ever created: a project that lacks any of these files (or lacks the
entry) is left untouched. No directory is created by this migration.

Idempotency
-----------
Every removal is conditional on the entry being present, so a second run finds
nothing to do and returns ``success=True`` with the "already absent" note.
