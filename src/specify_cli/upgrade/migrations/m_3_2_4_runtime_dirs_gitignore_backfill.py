"""Migration: backfill ``.kittify/migrations/`` + ``.kittify/logs/`` gitignore (#2384).

Sibling to ``3.2.4_derived_mission_views_gitignore_backfill`` (#2369). Two more
generated ``.kittify/`` subtrees are registered ``IGNORED`` state surfaces — so a
fresh ``spec-kitty init`` gitignores them — but already-initialised projects had
no backfill for them, so they showed up untracked and failed ``spec-kitty
accept``'s ``git_dirty`` check:

- ``.kittify/migrations/`` — mission-state repair manifests + quarantine backups
  (write-only local audit/recovery output).
- ``.kittify/logs/`` — per-WP implementation/review console logs (orchestrator).

This backfill adds both directory entries to ``.gitignore`` for projects that
lack them. Following the ``3.2.3_encoding_provenance`` precedent, the entries are
**hardcoded here** rather than sourced from the live contract so the migration's
behaviour is frozen and deterministic regardless of future contract changes.
