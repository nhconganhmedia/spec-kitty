"""Migration: backfill ``.agents/skills/`` + skills-manifest gitignore coverage (#2412).

The skills installer projects global canonical skills into the shared
``.agents/skills/`` root (codex/vibe/pi/letta), preferring **absolute
symlinks** into the user-global canonical root — machine-local content by
construction. ``.claude/`` and the other agent dirs are gitignored wholesale
by ``GitignoreManager.protect_all_agents()`` at init, but bare ``.agents/``
is absent from ``AGENT_DIRECTORIES``, so nothing ever ignored the shared
root: committing it puts ``/Users/<name>/...`` symlink blobs in the repo.
The per-machine install ledger ``.kittify/skills-manifest.json`` (timestamps,
content hashes, per-machine delivery_mode) had the same gap.

Both are now registered ``IGNORED`` state surfaces (``shared_skills_projection``
and ``skills_install_manifest`` in ``state/contract.py``), so a fresh
``spec-kitty init`` gitignores them via the full runtime entry set. This
backfill repairs already-initialised projects on ``spec-kitty upgrade``,
following the ``3.2.4_derived_mission_views`` precedent: the entries are
**hardcoded here** rather than sourced from the live contract so the
migration's behaviour is frozen and deterministic regardless of future
contract changes.

    status` keeps showing modifications) even though the path is "ignored"
    going forward. The post-condition this migration must hold is: no path is
    both tracked and gitignored. ``git rm --cached`` drops the path from the
    index while leaving the working-tree file untouched.

    has no ``git`` binary available) is left exactly as before -- matching
