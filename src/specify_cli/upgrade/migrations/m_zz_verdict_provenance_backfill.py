"""Migration ``verdict_provenance_backfill``: wire the FR-012 / SC-008 backfill.

Realises the operational half of ``verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35``:
the mission collapsed every verdict reader onto the event authority
(``status.events.jsonl``) and deleted the ``review-cycle-N.md`` frontmatter
readers -- the *irreversible* half of single-authority. The protective
backfill (:func:`~specify_cli.migration.verdict_provenance_backfill.
backfill_verdict_provenance`, SC-008) that reduces a pre-schema-change
terminal ``.md`` verdict into a hand-constructed ``review_result`` event
already existed but had **zero production callers**: an existing deployment
upgrading across the reader collapse could strand a historical rejection
(a WP with a terminal ``.md`` verdict and no event ``review_result`` slot),
so a consumer reading the retired authority mid-upgrade would miss it.

This module is that caller. It is an *auto-discovered* upgrade migration
(``@MigrationRegistry.register`` + ``pkgutil.iter_modules`` -- no static
importer) that runs the backfill over **every** mission under
``kitty-specs/`` on ``spec-kitty upgrade``.

Reuse, not re-implementation
----------------------------
The one and only backfill spine lives in
:func:`specify_cli.migration.verdict_provenance_backfill.backfill_verdict_provenance`.
This module adds only the corpus walk; it never touches the write path itself.
The provenance predicate
(:func:`~specify_cli.migration.verdict_provenance_backfill.stranded_verdict_findings`)
drives :meth:`detect` / the dry-run preview so the migration is a true no-op
on a corpus with nothing to recover.

Idempotency (NFR-002)
---------------------
``backfill_verdict_provenance`` is idempotent by construction: it keys each
seeded event on a deterministic ULID over ``(mission_id, wp_id, verdict,
cycle)`` and skips any WP that already carries a ``review_result`` event
slot. A second ``apply()`` over an unchanged corpus therefore appends
nothing (``appended_count == 0`` for every mission) -- ``detect()`` returns
``False`` once the corpus is converged, and even a forced re-run is a no-op.

Version-key ordering
--------------------
``target_version = "3.2.6rc1"`` -- tied to the installed package version
(``pyproject.toml``), the same still-unreleased cycle as the sibling
``m_zz_runtime_state_backfill.py``. The ``m_zz_`` filename prefix keeps this
module importing (and registering) after the ``m_unify_charter_activation*``
charter folds at the same tied version, exactly as its runtime-state sibling
documents -- ordering between the two ``m_zz_*`` backfills is immaterial (they
touch disjoint on-disk state). The semantic identifier stays on
``migration_id`` below.
