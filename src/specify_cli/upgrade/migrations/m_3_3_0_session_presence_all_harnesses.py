"""Migration: install session presence orientation for all non-Claude harnesses.

Phase 2 counterpart to ``m_3_3_0_session_presence_claude_code.py`` (Phase 1).

Iterates over configured agents from ``.kittify/config.yaml`` (via
``load_agent_config``), excluding ``"claude"`` (handled by Phase 1).  For
each configured harness:

1. ``writer.can_write(project_path)`` — harness root exists in this project.
2. ``writer.has_presence(project_path)`` — orientation already written.

If ``can_write`` is True and ``has_presence`` is False, the orientation block
is written.  The migration is idempotent: re-running it after all blocks have
been written is a no-op.

Only agents listed in ``.kittify/config.yaml`` are processed (C-005).
Harness directories present on disk but not in config are ignored.

``detect()`` returns ``True`` when *any* configured non-Claude harness needs its
orientation written, allowing ``spec-kitty upgrade`` to surface the migration
only for projects where work remains.
