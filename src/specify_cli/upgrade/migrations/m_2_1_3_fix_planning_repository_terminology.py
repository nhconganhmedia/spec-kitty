"""Migration: replace 'planning repository' with 'project root checkout' in agent command files.

Agents interpret 'planning repository' as a separate repository, causing
features to be created in the wrong project. The intended meaning was always
'the main checkout of this repository, not a worktree.'

This migration performs a text replacement in all agent command/prompt files
that contain the old terminology.
