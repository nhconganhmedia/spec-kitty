"""Normalize legacy mission lifecycle inputs for the 3.2.0a4 MVP model.

This migration repairs historical ``kitty-specs`` missions enough that the
canonical lifecycle model can classify them consistently. It backfills
identity, rebuilds missing event logs from legacy state, and regenerates the
status/progress/lifecycle projections consumed by the CLI and Teamspace.
