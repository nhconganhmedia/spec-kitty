"""Multi-file issue-reference discovery (T028, FR-004, #1738).

Generalizes ``tasks.issue_matrix.detect_issue_references`` -- which reads
``spec.md`` **only** -- to every mission artifact that can legitimately carry
a load-bearing GH issue reference: ``spec.md``, ``plan.md``, ``research.md``,
``analysis-report.md``, plus every ``.md`` file directly under ``tasks/`` and
``contracts/``.

This module reuses the ONE canonical single-file detector
(:func:`specify_cli.tasks.issue_matrix.detect_issue_references`) per scanned
file -- same ``#NNNN`` regex, same canonicalization -- so there remains
exactly one issue-reference pattern definition in the codebase (WP08 risk:
"avoid a fourth definition"). This module owns only two concerns: *which*
files to scan, and how to merge/dedupe references discovered across them.

``detect_issue_references`` is NOT deleted or edited here (it is owned by
WP05): :func:`specify_cli.tasks.issue_matrix.scaffold_issue_matrix` still
calls it directly against ``spec.md`` alone for the initial-scaffold use case
(B3), so it remains a live building block. It IS superseded for
completeness/enforcement purposes -- the three enforcement sites
(``status.doctor.check_issue_matrix``,
``cli.commands.agent.tasks_parsing_validation._issue_matrix_evaluation`` /
``_issue_matrix_approval_blocker``) and the merge-time completeness gate
(``policy.merge_gates``) now call :func:`discover_issue_references` instead
(write-side-seam-matrix-tracer-01KYP3MH WP08, T029/T030).
