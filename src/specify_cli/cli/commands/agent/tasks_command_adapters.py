"""Seam-routed coord-router construction for the ``agent tasks`` families.

Mission ``tasks-py-degod-wave2-01KWH9EQ`` FR-004 originally relocated three
``RealCoordCommitRouter`` **subclasses** (``_MoveTaskCoordRouter``,
``_MapReqCoordRouter``, ``_MarkStatusCoordRouter``) out of ``tasks.py``. The
degod-follow-ups pre-merge squad flagged those subclasses as near-triplicated
bodies that bent the one-adapter-per-port rule (C-004) — they existed ONLY to
re-resolve the two WRITE seams through the ``tasks`` namespace (and, for
``map_requirements``, to thread ``target_branch``). This module replaces them
with **constructor DI**: a single production adapter class
(:class:`RealCoordCommitRouter`) plus the two seam-wrapper functions and the
:func:`seam_coord_router` factory below. There is now ZERO per-family
duplication and exactly one production coord adapter class.

**Why this module still exists** (import-cycle break): the seam wrappers and the
factory reference :class:`RealCoordCommitRouter` from
``specify_cli.agent_tasks_ports`` — the top-level ports module, which imports
downward only. Keeping the seam construction here (never in ``tasks.py``) means
this module imports only the ports module, stdlib, and core modules at module
scope, and NEVER ``tasks`` itself at import time (cycle-safe by construction).
The tasks-namespace resolution happens LAZILY, inside the seam wrappers, at call
time.

**Seam bridge / late binding** (research.md D1): the two wrappers
:func:`_seam_commit_for_mission` / :func:`_seam_emit_status_transition_transactional`
do a lazy in-function import of the ``tasks`` module
(``from specify_cli.cli.commands.agent import tasks as _tasks``) and call
``_tasks.<attr>(...)``, so a ``@patch("...agent.tasks.<symbol>")`` applied AFTER
router construction still INTERCEPTS. ``tasks.py`` re-exports
:func:`seam_coord_router` (explicit ``as`` re-export) so the ``_default_*_ports``
factories construct through a patchable ``tasks.seam_coord_router`` binding.

Per-symbol routing/interception evidence:
``kitty-specs/tasks-py-degod-wave2-01KWH9EQ/seam-checklist.md`` (Layer 4 of
the parity contract).
