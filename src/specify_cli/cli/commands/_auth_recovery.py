"""Logged-out-on-connected-teamspace detection helpers (Mission 7, issue #829).

This module provides the read-only detector and canonical stderr formatter
that ``specify_cli.readiness`` calls when authentication is missing but the
local repo state shows a prior teamspace connection.

Public surface:

- ``detect_logged_out_with_connected_teamspace``: read-only detector.
- ``emit_structured_stderr``: writes the canonical CI-readable line.

The former interactive ``[L]ogin / [S]kip / [Q]uit`` recovery facade
(``handle_unauthenticated_with_teamspace``, ``offer_login_recovery``,
``RecoveryOutcome``, ``EXIT_LOGGED_OUT_ON_CONNECTED_TEAMSPACE``,
``is_interactive``) was built for the ``spec-kitty sync ...`` commands' own
auth-missing branches. Those commands were deleted with the sync transport
(issue #5); the readiness coordinator's non-blocking guidance renderer
(``specify_cli.readiness.render``) replaced them and deliberately does not
block command startup on a keystroke prompt. The facade was pruned as dead
collateral (issue #116) rather than kept for a caller that will not return.

All third-party / heavy imports (``TokenManager``) are deferred to call-site
to keep import cost low and to keep test isolation tractable.
