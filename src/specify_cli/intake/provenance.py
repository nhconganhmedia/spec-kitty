"""Provenance escape helpers (FR-007 / WP02 T007).

Provenance lines (``source_file: ...``) are written into HTML / Markdown
comments and into a YAML sidecar.  The raw input is operator-controlled
file-system data, but we treat it as untrusted: anything that lets the
input break out of a comment context (``-->``), simulate a C-style
comment terminator (``*/``), inject markdown headings (leading ``#``),
or smuggle ASCII control characters into downstream prompts is
forbidden.

The contract for :func:`escape_for_comment` lives in
``kitty-specs/<mission>/contracts/intake-source-provenance.md`` and the
behaviour is pinned by ``tests/unit/intake/test_provenance_escape.py``.
