"""OrphanChecker: detect DRG nodes that have no expected incoming edges.

A node is "orphaned" when it belongs to a kind that, by convention, must
be referenced by at least one other node via a specific relation — but no
such edge exists in the graph.

Supported orphan-detection rules
---------------------------------
``directive`` nodes   → expected inbound relation: one of ``"scope"``,
                        ``"requires"``, ``"suggests"``, ``"applies"``, or
                        ``"refines"`` (the relations the built-in doctrine
                        layer actually emits toward directives) — OR an
                        *outgoing* ``"reconciles_tension"`` edge, since an
                        active reconciliation directive is by design the
                        *source* of its reconciliation edges, never their
                        target, and would otherwise misfire as orphaned.
``glossary_scope``    → expected inbound relation: ``"vocabulary"``

Prior to this fix, ``directive`` nodes required an inbound ``"governs"``
edge and ``adr`` nodes required inbound ``"supersedes"`` or ``"references"``.
None of ``governs``, ``supersedes``, or ``references`` is a member of the
``Relation`` enum (``src/charter/offering/drg/models.py``), so those edges could
never be authored — the rules misfired on every built-in directive/adr node
regardless of how well-connected it actually was (issue #2737). The
``directive`` rule now checks the relations the graph actually emits; the
``adr`` rule is retired outright since no real relation ever backed it and
no ``adr`` node kind exists in the built-in layer today.

Incoming-edge rules are checked using ``get_incoming_edges()`` from the
``_drg`` helper which uses ``edge.relation`` (not ``edge.type``). The
outgoing-edge reconciliation exemption is checked directly against
``drg.edges`` (see ``_has_exempting_outgoing_edge``).
