"""Fail-closed secret redaction for governed ``SPEC_KITTY_*`` env-var rendering.

Contract: ``kitty-specs/operator-config-ergonomics-01M04YK8/contracts/
provenance-and-channel.md`` C-SEC-1 -- a var NOT on the printable-var
allowlist below (e.g. ``SPEC_KITTY_SAAS_TOKEN``) must never appear BY VALUE
in ``doctor``/``sync status``/logs; only its name and presence may be
reported. This is the single authority every such rendering surface routes
through (starting with the env-file doctor sibling, T019) -- a var never
seen before (new, untriaged, or simply misspelled) is redacted by default,
because :func:`redact` is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist: absence from
``_PRINTABLE_VARS`` is what triggers redaction, not presence on some
"known secret" list. That is the fail-closed property.

#: Names safe to render BY VALUE. Deliberately conservative: a name is only

#: *looks* harmless -- is redacted (fail-closed, C-SEC-1). This allowlist is
#: intentionally narrower than the full ``SPEC_KITTY_*`` vocabulary; process-
#: internal/derived vars (e.g. ``SPEC_KITTY_CLI_VERSION``,
#: ``SPEC_KITTY_WORKTREE_PATH``) are simply never routed through this
#: module's callers, so they need no explicit denial here.
