"""Commit-guard policy module — the ONE protection decision (ADR 2026-06-03-2, IC-02, D1).

Mission ``tooling-stability-guard-coherence-01KTRC04`` (FR-001, FR-008,
contracts C-GUARD-1 / C-GUARD-2 / C-GUARD-3a). This module is the **Shared
Kernel** policy seam: a single pure function, :func:`evaluate`, decides whether
a commit may land on its declared destination. Every commit-creating surface
routes its protection decision here and *nowhere else* (C-GUARD-1).

Mechanism / policy split
------------------------

``safe_commit`` (``git/commit_helpers.py``) is the *mechanism* — it stages,
backstops, and creates the commit. The *policy* — "is this destination allowed?"
— is decided solely by :func:`evaluate`. The split is what makes the guard
auditable: the decision is a pure function of explicit, typed inputs.

Capability is asserted-at-the-surface (FR-008 / C-GUARD-2)
----------------------------------------------------------

:class:`GuardCapability` is a **parameter** the caller passes explicitly. It is
NEVER derived from commit-message text, committed-file content, or ambient
environment. Its value is *auditability* for the LLM-agent threat model — a
greppable, typed authorization at the call site — not unforgeability. The
default is :attr:`GuardCapability.STANDARD`, which authorizes only the
placement-matched commit and no protected-branch bookkeeping flow.

Each non-standard capability authorizes exactly ONE bookkeeping flow onto a
protected ref; no capability authorizes a different flow, and **no capability
can grant a direct push to ``origin/main``** — pushing is outside this guard's
reach entirely (it never pushes; see ``test_commit_helpers_module_performs_no_push``).

Destination authority (C-GUARD-3a)
----------------------------------

:func:`evaluate` ECHOES :attr:`CommitTarget.ref` as the resolved destination —
it never re-derives a destination from any other source. ``--to-branch`` and
context resolution flow INTO the :class:`CommitTarget` *before* evaluation, so
there is exactly one destination authority.

Naming note
-----------

:class:`GuardVerdict` is intentionally DISTINCT from
``policy.merge_gates.GateVerdict`` / ``GateResult``: near-twin shape, different
domain (commit protection vs merge gating). Do not unify them.

Operator escape hatch
---------------------

The ambient env hatch ``SPEC_KITTY_ALLOW_PROTECTED_BRANCH_COMMITS`` is the ONE
retained operator channel (solo-fork operators who own ``main``). It is
consumed in ``git/commit_helpers.py`` by the protected-branch pre-checks and by
``safe_commit``'s :class:`ProtectionState` input computation — the operator
declares the branch unprotected for this repo. It never reaches this module:
:func:`evaluate` is environment-free and decides purely on the typed inputs it
is handed.
