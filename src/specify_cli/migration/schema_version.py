"""Schema version detection and compatibility checking for Spec Kitty projects.

This module replaces heuristic version detection with a single integer comparison.
Every project carries a ``spec_kitty.schema_version`` integer in
``.kittify/metadata.yaml``.  The CLI refuses to operate on projects whose schema
version does not match ``REQUIRED_SCHEMA_VERSION``.
