# C-001 relocation (WP04 / #3599): the manifest schema types now live in
# charter.offering.missions.expected_artifact_manifest -- re-exported from their new
# home (specify_cli -> doctrine is a legal direction). ManifestRegistry
# stays specify_cli-owned and keeps importing from .manifest. The explicit
# ``as <name>`` self-aliases are the standard PEP 484 explicit-re-export
# marker (ruff/mypy both honor it) -- these three are deliberately NOT in
# __all__ below: no other src/ file imports them via this package path
# (indexer.py now goes straight to charter.offering.missions), and adding them to
# __all__ without such a caller reds tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py.
# The attribute is still importable for any external caller of this package.
