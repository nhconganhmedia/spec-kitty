"""The single tracker-egress verdict: one local consent channel, one named destination (#3108).

**One function decides whether tracker data may leave the machine.**
:func:`tracker_egress_verdict` reads the project's own committed ``tracker.egress`` key and a
caller-supplied :class:`EgressDestination` into one :class:`TrackerEgressVerdict`. Both the
gates that raise and the diagnostic surfaces call this same function, so the enforced answer
and the reported answer cannot disagree.

**What was removed with the sync transport (issue #5).** The module used to compose *two*
channels: the local ``tracker.egress`` key (kept, below) and per-project hosted-sync consent
("Channel 1", resolved through the deleted ``sync.consent`` / ``sync.routing`` chain and its
project store). Hosted-sync consent is meaningless now that there is no hosted sync to
consent to, so that channel retired with its transport. Hosted tracker egress rides the
operator's authenticated SaaS session; team-side admission is the capability mint's job
(design: ephemeral-team-status), not this module's.

**Channel 2 -- the project's own committed ``tracker.egress`` key** in
``.kittify/config.yaml``: ``absent`` / ``refused`` / ``permitted`` / ``fault``. Decoded by
:func:`_resolve_channel2` from :class:`~specify_cli.tracker.config.TrackerProjectConfig`.

**Channel 1's own reporting classifier had already retired before issue #5, for the record.**
Before Channel 1 itself was removed, its diagnostic re-derivation had already gone: the
registry contract Channel 1's answer was funneled through, ``_egress_consent_resolver:
Callable[[Path], bool] | None`` at **``invocation/adapters.py:81``**, manufactured an
``EgressConsent`` member from a bare ``bool``, discarding *why* a project was refused. A
now-deleted, privately-named classifier re-derived that "why" by reaching around the registry
straight into the deleted ``specify_cli.sync.consent``/``specify_cli.sync.routing`` chain --
a second, independent resolution of facts the enforcing resolver had already resolved once.
Sibling Bundle B's open **Q3** gave that resolver contract a decision-carrying return value
instead of a bare ``bool``, so there was nothing left for the classifier to re-derive: the
egress-single-authority mission (WP03) **delete**d it, **not migrate**d it. Issue #5 then
retired the channel that classifier used to describe in its entirety, so this paragraph is
now purely historical -- there is no Channel 1 left for any classifier to report on.

Polarity follows the destination, and this is deliberate, not a simplification
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

``EgressDestination.LOCAL_SUBPROCESS`` (``beads``/``fp``): Channel 2 is **two-way** --
``refused`` refuses, and ``permitted`` grants. The subprocess spawn is exactly the leak the
key exists to gate: issue fields travel into an executable the operator configured
machine-globally, so only an explicit committed grant (or explicit refusal) decides.

``EgressDestination.HOSTED_SERVICE``: Channel 2 is **narrowing only** -- a committed
``refused`` (or an illegal/unreadable value) still refuses, because that is the operator's own
explicit instruction and this module must not silently override it; but ``permitted`` cannot
*grant* hosted egress, and absence cannot either -- both fall through to permit, since the
request rides the operator's authenticated SaaS session and there is no longer a Channel 1 to
defer to. So this key can only ever narrow a hosted request, never widen one.
