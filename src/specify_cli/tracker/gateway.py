"""Local Beads program gateway (TRK-M1-04).

TRK-M1-04 node criteria (``docs/BEADS_PROGRAM_GRAPH.json``): "Host adapter
maps Tracker calls through token-valid program gateway, preserves mission/
task/team/repository scope, exposes authority/freshness/conflicts, and
cannot assign/close/approve/release Beads or bypass self-claim/review/
publication."

``spec_kitty_tracker``'s local/native connectors (``BeadsConnector``,
``FPConnector``) accept a caller-supplied
``spec_kitty_tracker.context.LocalExecutionContext`` and an injectable
``spec_kitty_tracker.connectors.cli_runner.CommandRunner`` (TRK-M1-02 A3/A4)
so a host can attribute and scope every call instead of falling back to the
package's default direct-subprocess runner. This module is that host-owned
runner: a Spec Kitty CLI concern, never imported by ``spec_kitty_tracker``
itself (``spec_kitty_tracker.errors.ScopeViolationError``'s docstring: "not a
:class:`TrackerContractError` -- ... Production raise sites are host
territory (TRK-M1-04/05; TRK-M1-06 N7)").

``spec_kitty_tracker>=0.5`` (the landed TRK-M1-02/03 kernel) is required to
actually construct a gateway-backed ``BeadsConnector`` via
:func:`build_gateway_beads_connector` -- ``LocalExecutionContext`` and the
capability-negotiation flags do not exist in the currently-PyPI-published
0.4.x line. Every import of ``spec_kitty_tracker`` in this module is
therefore deferred into function bodies (mirroring
``specify_cli/tracker/factory.py``'s existing "spec-kitty-tracker is not
installed" pattern) so the module itself imports cleanly, and
:class:`TrackerGatewayToken`/:class:`GatewayCommandRunner` are usable with a
duck-typed execution-context stand-in, regardless of the installed tracker
package version.

    Two independent adversarial reviews (Renata REJECT, TRK-M1-04) found
    that a finite *deny*-list against ``bd`` 1.2.2's real surface can never

    ``epic close-eligible``, ``supersede --with``, ``duplicate --of``,
    ``duplicates --auto-merge``, ``delete --force``, ``reopen``, ``assign``),
    ``bd``'s done-category statuses are themselves user-configurable
    (``bd config set status.custom ...``) -- a status-*value* blacklist is
    structurally unable to enumerate a caller-defined vocabulary. This
    module therefore inverts the control: deny-by-default, allow-list only
    the exact read/query and non-lifecycle-write subcommand paths the
    tracker adapter actually issues (see :data:`_ALLOWED_SUBCOMMAND_PATHS`),
    with the sole further guard on the two allow-listed write paths being an
    absolute, spelling-independent ban on the *flags* that carry lifecycle
    meaning (``--assignee``/``-a``, ``--status``/``-s``, ``--claim`` --
    banned outright, never gated on the value that follows them, precisely
    because no finite value list can keep up with a configurable status
