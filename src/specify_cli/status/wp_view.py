"""Canonical WP-view reconstruction reader (IC-07 / FR-012).

ONE reader — :func:`reconstruct_wp_view` — that assembles a work package's
runtime view from TWO distinct, never-conflated sources:

* ``resolved`` — the *actual* runtime state, event-sourced from the reduced
  snapshot (:func:`specify_cli.status.reducer.wp_snapshot_state`): ``lane``,
  ``agent``, ``assignee``, ``subtasks``, ``review``, and the resolved-binding
  actuals ``role`` / ``agent_profile`` (+ ``agent_profile_version``) / ``model``
  / ``provider``.
* ``authored`` — the *recommended* assignment, read from the WP frontmatter:
  authored ``role`` / ``agent_profile`` / ``model`` plus the static planning
  fields (``subtasks`` / ``owned_files`` / ``dependencies`` /
  ``requirement_refs``).

The single load-bearing rule (C-008 / INV-7): **authored intent and resolved
actual are NEVER conflated.** A WP with no resolved-binding slots yields a
populated ``authored`` group and an *empty* ``resolved`` group — the authored
value is NEVER returned inside the ``resolved`` group (no masquerade). This is
the split-brain the mission exists to close: three consumers (dashboard scanner,
``agent tasks status`` board, :class:`~specify_cli.task_utils.support.WorkPackage`)
previously hand-rolled their own snapshot gate; they now all reconstruct through
this single reader (SC-007), so they can never disagree.

The reader is **unconditional** against the snapshot (IC-03): it always reads
through ``wp_snapshot_state``; there is no phase-flag branch. Absent runtime
state degrades every ``resolved`` field to its empty value (tolerate-absent).

**Scope: identity/runtime fields ONLY.** Presentation concerns owned by the
dashboard consumer (``title`` regex, ``prompt_markdown``, ``prompt_path``) are
NOT produced here — pulling them into the reader would regress the dashboard
(they would be swallowed). The reader's contract is identity/runtime only.
