"""Resolved-binding carrier for the dispatch→claim linkage (FR-014 / IC-08).

The *genuinely dispatch-resolved* runtime identity — which model the routing
catalog recommended and which profile the registry resolved — lives only on the
invocation/Op path (``invocation/executor.py`` ``RoutingRecommendation`` /
``registry.resolve``, recorded in ``invocation/record.py`` keyed by
``invocation_id``). This module carries that resolution from the CLI claim
commands (``--model``/``--profile``/``--invocation-id`` on
``cli/commands/agent/workflow.py``) into the claim seams so the claim-time emit
records the WP's **resolved binding**.

The single load-bearing rule (C-007 / INV-6): every field here originates from
the dispatch resolver / ``registry.resolve`` / the Op record — **NEVER** a copy
of the frontmatter ``agent_profile`` string. Frontmatter is authored intent
(the *recommendation*); this carrier is the resolved *actual*. Placed in the
status package so both the invocation layer and the claim seams import it
without a runtime→charter→doctrine boundary violation.

#: NO model on the dispatch path (SC-011 explicit-absent). A reader sees this
#: exact value and can tell three states apart:
#:   * ``"__resolved_model_absent__"`` — a pick-up ran but resolved no model;
#:   * a real model string (e.g. ``"claude-opus-4-8"``) — resolved to that model;
#:   * slot missing entirely — no resolved binding was ever recorded.
#: It is a plain ``str`` so it survives the JSONL round-trip, and it is chosen so
#: it cannot be confused with a real model id. Recording it (rather than leaving
#: the slot untouched with ``None``) is what makes latest-wins reduction overwrite
#: a stale model when a later pick-up genuinely resolved none — never fabricated,
#: never frontmatter-coerced.
