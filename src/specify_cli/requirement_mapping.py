# --- #3394: declared-requirement scoping -----------------------------------
#
# A spec.md may legitimately CITE a foreign requirement id in prose (e.g.
# "...easy to miss, see FR-021's default-pack materialization") without that
# citation being a requirement THIS spec declares. ``_REF_FIND_PATTERN``
# alone can't distinguish a citation from a declaration -- it matches both,
# which is #3394: a WP-coverage-eligible spec's own three requirements pass,
# but a mid-sentence citation of another mission's already-shipped FR gets
# treated as an FR this spec must also route to a work package.
#
# A requirement is "declared" (not merely cited) when it opens the line as
# one of four canonical shapes seen across the spec-template corpus
# (kitty-specs/) and the test-fixture corpus alike: the id column of a
# markdown table row (``| FR-001 | ... |``), a heading naming the id
# (``### FR-001`` / ``### FR-001: Title``), a bulleted/numbered list item
# (``- FR-001: ...``, ``- **FR-001**: ...``, ``1. FR-001 ...``), or a bold id
# leading a bare paragraph (``**FR-001 — Title.** body...``). A prose sentence
# that merely *mentions* an id in passing -- not at the start of a table
# cell, heading, bullet, or bold span -- matches none of the four and is
# correctly excluded.
# The id cell itself is sometimes bold (``| **FR-001** | ... |``, common
# across kitty-specs/) or struck through to mark a retired requirement
# (``| ~~FR-006~~ | ...``, e.g. mission retrospective-durable-home-01KVYM1W) --
# optional leading/trailing ``**``/``~~`` around the id, either or both.
#
# Corpus-validation note (#3394 review F2): the four shapes above and the
# decision NOT to hard-fail when a document matches none of them were
# validated against the 366-spec ``kitty-specs/`` corpus during the #3394 Op
# (``01KZYBXE5G1Y8J4C5FAYV1FKN1``). A stricter, hard-failing prototype (refuse
# whenever raw ``FR``/``NFR``/``C`` tokens are present but none match a
# declared shape) was measured at roughly a 6% false-positive rate against
# that corpus and rejected for that reason; the prototype and its measurement
# were not preserved outside the Op transcript, so this sentence is the
# durable record of the number and the rationale. See
# :func:`find_undeclared_requirement_citations` below for the soft,
# non-blocking warning shipped instead of that rejected hard-fail layer.

    ``find_undeclared_requirement_citations`` (#3395, above) fires only when a
    scope's *own* declared-id set is entirely empty (``section_raw_tokens and
    not _declared_ids(section)``) -- it is structurally blind to a section
    that declares SOME requirements correctly and writes OTHERS as bare,
    unbulleted, unbolded prose in that same section (#3396's exact repro: a
    declared ``NFR-001`` table row alongside bare-prose ``FR-001``/``FR-002``
    sentences under one "Functional Requirements" heading). Verified
    directly: ``find_undeclared_requirement_citations`` returns ``[]``
    against that repro, because the section's declared set is non-empty
    (``NFR-001`` is declared). This function is a distinct, NEW predicate --
    not a promotion of that one -- asking a finer-grained, per-line question
    instead: "does *this specific line* declare its own token, and if not, is
    that token declared *anywhere in the document*?"

    Algorithm (mirrors plan.md's "Architecture" section literally):

    1. ``document_declared = _declared_ids(spec_content)`` -- the existing,
       unmodified, whole-document declared-id set (C-001: the four
       ``_DECLARED_ID_PATTERNS`` shapes are not touched or widened here).
    2. For each ``(heading_text, body)`` in ``_requirement_named_sections`` --
       heading-scoping reused byte-identical (C-008: ``_is_requirement_heading``
       is NOT broadened in this mission; a bare-prose ``C-XXX`` item under a
       ``### Constraints`` heading remains a disclosed, out-of-scope blind
       spot -- see WP07).
    3. For each line in ``body``: if the line matches one of the four
       ``_DECLARED_ID_PATTERNS``, raw-token scanning of the REST of that line
       is skipped entirely -- the load-bearing rule that keeps a foreign or
       malformed id-shaped token in a properly-declared table row's own
       description column from being mistaken for a second, undeclared
       requirement (Story 2 AC3; the exact false-positive class that drove
       #3395's rejected doc-wide prototype's ~6% rate). Otherwise, the line is
       scanned for every ``_REF_FIND_PATTERN`` token; any token not present in
       ``document_declared`` is a bare-prose candidate, recorded against that
       section's heading.

    Scope is document-level, not section-level (C-006), by design: a token
    declared elsewhere in the document is already counted as a requirement,
    so a section merely citing it again is not a lost requirement.

    **Measured rate of this shipped function** -- re-verified independently
    twice with identical results, against the full ``kitty-specs/*/spec.md``
    corpus (N=368, measured 2026-08-14): **1/368 = 0.27%** of specs flag.
    The sole hit is ``kitty-specs/egress-refusal-consolidation-3110-
    01KYW895/spec.md``, section "Requirement-level falsifiers", ids
    ``C-1`` and ``C-3``. That hit is a **foreign-id citation**: the spec
    explicitly disambiguates its own constraint ids (``C-001``..``C-011``)
    from the orchestrator's self-correction ids (``C-1``..``C-4``, tracked
    in that mission's own ``ORCHESTRATOR-NOTES.md``) -- so this is a false
    positive, and the function's true-positive count over this corpus is
    **zero**.

    **Reconciliation -- do not mistake these for this function's rate.**
    The ``9/368 = 2.45%`` and ``139/368 = 37.77%`` figures below were
    measured during design against an *earlier, broader prototype* that did
    NOT apply this function's per-line declared-shape skip (step 3 below:
    "if the line matches ... raw-token scanning of the REST of that line is
    skipped entirely"). They describe that earlier, different predicate --
    not the per-line-skip-gated function shipped here -- and are retained
    only as the historical evidence for the document-scoped-vs-section-
    scoped design choice (C-006) immediately below; a future maintainer must
    not read them as this function's own false-positive rate.

    - **Document-scoped prototype** (matches this function's C-006 scoping
      choice, measured without the per-line skip rule): 9/368 = 2.45% of
      specs newly flagged.
    - **Section-scoped prototype** (rejected alternative -- "declared"
      meaning declared *within this section* rather than anywhere in the
      document, same pre-skip-rule scan): 139/368 = 37.77% of specs newly
      flagged -- 15x more than the document-scoped prototype figure, from
      the document-vs-section design choice alone.

    Document-scoped is the only correct reading (C-006) and is what this
    function implements; both prototype rates are recorded together here so
    a future maintainer cannot reasonably reintroduce the rejected
    section-scoped version without seeing the cost it was measured to
    carry.

    **WP07 -- false-negative sample + re-verified broadened-predicate FP figure
    (measured 2026-08-14, N=368, method: `tests/specify_cli/
    test_bare_prose_false_negative_sample.py`, a read-only corpus scan with the
    heading predicate locally broadened to also match "constraint" -- reusing
    this function's own per-line algorithm against the broadened section
    scoping, mirroring plan.md's PLAN-GOV-002 method; production
    `_is_requirement_heading` is untouched and byte-identical).** C-008's
    disposition (option (b), above) leaves `C-XXX` bare-prose items under a
    `### Constraints` heading structurally invisible to this function -- 325 of
    368 specs (88.32%) use that heading. This is the disclosure of that blind
    spot's two sides:

    - **Broadened-predicate FP rate (re-verified)**: 5/368 = 1.36% of specs are
      newly flagged when the heading predicate is broadened to also match
      "constraint" -- identical to PLAN-GOV-002's plan-time figure, same 5
      specs (`coord-read-residuals-merge-lanes-and-identity-routing-01KW2M8V`,
      `doctrine-public-api-surface-01KZPDSR`,
      `drg-relation-impacts-vocabulary-01KYFV87`,
      `foundational-values-creed-band-01KYFV8N`,
      `test-quality-doctrine-series-01KYFV8H`), independently re-run and
      re-verified rather than copied on trust.
    - **False-negative sample**: manual review of all 5 newly-flagged tokens
      found **zero genuine bare-prose requirements the shipped detector
      misses** -- zero true positives, matching PLAN-GOV-002's own
      classification. Two (`C-009` citing a sibling mission's own constraint
      id; `C-010` citing another mission's requirement from a narrative
      "Carried constraints" scratch heading) are foreign-id citations, the
      same class as this function's own 1/368 measured rate above. Two more
      (`C-009`, `C-005`) are likewise foreign/cross-mission citations under
      narrative "Carried constraints" scratch headings -- not the canonical
      `### Constraints` requirements table C-008 is about, so they are also
      instances of the broadened predicate's substring over-match risk (a
      plain `"constraint"` match also catching non-canonical prose headings),
      not the Constraints-heading blind spot itself. The remaining one
      (`C-007`, `doctrine-public-api-surface-01KZPDSR`) is this spec's own
      locally-declared `C-007-mission` id, mis-scanned as bare because its
      non-numeric-suffixed id text fails `_TABLE_ROW_ID_PATTERN`'s
      exact-digits capture (the same pre-existing, broadening-independent gap
      PLAN-GOV-002 already documented for `C-009-mirror`/`C-007-mission`
      shapes) -- not a requirement genuinely lost to bare prose either. This
      sample found no new evidence of a genuine missed requirement, but it
      does not retire the underlying structural blind spot (325/368 specs use
      a Constraints heading this function cannot see); a future spec with a
      genuine undeclared `C-XXX` under that heading would still go
      undetected. Informational only (Story 4 AC4) -- not a shipping gate,
      and does not change this function's behavior or measured rate above.

    Returns:
        One :class:`BareProseCandidate` per requirement-named section that
        contains at least one bare-prose candidate id -- sections with none
        are omitted. This pure function never catches an exception to return
        a quietly empty/clean result (NFR-002: silent-success prohibition);
        whatever the underlying section-scoping / declared-id computation
        raises propagates unchanged. The call-site wrapping that converts
        such an exception into an explicit, blocking failure message for
        callers is a separate concern, delivered per call site elsewhere in
        this mission.
