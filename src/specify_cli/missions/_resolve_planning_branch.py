"""Canonical resolution of a mission's merge target branch (FR-012).

Pre-WP07, ``mission.py`` resolved the planning / merge target branch by
inspecting the current checkout via ``_show_branch_context``. When an
operator ran ``spec-kitty agent mission finalize-tasks`` from a
``prep/...`` branch (a common workaround pattern for the legacy
``main``-pin guard), the prep branch name leaked into every WP's
``merge_target_branch`` frontmatter. The prep branch was later deleted
once the human moved on, at which point lane allocation crashed because
its parent ref was gone.

WP07 closes this leak. ``mission create`` already persists the canonical
target in ``meta.json`` (``target_branch`` field) at the moment the
operator was definitively on the right base. We read that value here and
refuse to fall back to ``git branch --show-current``.

Public surface:

* :class:`PlanningBranchResolutionFailed` — structured error raised when
  ``meta.json`` does not carry a usable target_branch. The CLI surface
  catches this and prints an actionable message that mentions the
  ``--target-branch`` override.
* :func:`resolve_planning_branch_from_meta` — pure helper that takes a
  mission meta dict and returns the canonical target branch.
* :func:`load_mission_target_branch` — convenience helper that reads
  ``meta.json`` from disk and resolves.

FR-012 acceptance: every WP frontmatter and ``lanes.json`` carries the
canonical merge target regardless of which branch ``finalize-tasks``
runs from.

    FR-008 / #2139 triage note: this function is a pure ``Mapping`` transform
    (not a ``feature_dir`` reader) with a contract that deliberately diverges
    from ``read_target_branch_from_meta`` on two axes -- the
    ``merge_target_branch`` legacy-alias fallback, and strict
    ``isinstance(raw, str)`` type-checking (a non-string ``target_branch``,
    e.g. ``42``, is treated as absent here, whereas the authority coerces via
    ``str(value)``). It already fail-closes via
    :class:`PlanningBranchResolutionFailed` rather than a silent
    ``"main"``/``""`` default, so it does not exhibit the divergence FR-008
    targets; it is intentionally left as its own contract rather than routed
    through the authority (routing would drop the legacy-alias fallback and
