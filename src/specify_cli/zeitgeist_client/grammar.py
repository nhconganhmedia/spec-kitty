"""The single identity/ref grammar, re-homed from zeitgeist.

Literal transcription of ``zeitgeist/editor.py:146-192`` (Z1.md §3.2 item 2).
Z1 cannot import the ``zeitgeist`` distribution — ``integrations/`` (where
this grammar lives upstream) ships to no package index (Z1.md §2.5) — so
parity is a committed-string / ported-logic copy, asserted by
``tests/zeitgeist_client/test_grammar.py`` (Z1.md §4 row N19) rather than by
import. Do not "improve" this file independently of its upstream twin: a
divergence here is exactly the failure mode Z1.md §4 N19 exists to catch.

Identity fields are VALIDATED, never repaired. A value that is not already a
well-formed, non-prose-shaped identifier is replaced with an opaque,
per-input-stable label — never coerced into a conforming shape (coercion can
manufacture something just as legible as the hostile input it started from).

Deliberate divergence from the upstream twin (#138): the ``ref`` bound here is
WIDER than zeitgeist/editor.py's. The relay's own schema —
``managed_live.schema.json`` ``EventSample.ref`` — declares only
``"maxLength": 240`` (no pattern, no segment rule), and this program's real
mission slugs ride that field: 48 of the 395 slugs in this repo's
``kitty-specs/`` are over editor.py's 64-char/6-segment bound, so a client
keeping the upstream bound replaced them with ``unknown-<digest>`` and the
watcher saw the moment but not which mission it belonged to. The character
class is unchanged; the length cap follows the schema, and
``MAX_SEGMENTS["ref"]`` is one more than the slug grammar's own measured
maximum (9): ``transport.py``'s ``focus_ref = f"{mission_slug}.{wp_id}"``
appends a tenth ``.``-delimited segment, so the bound this module must pass
is the composed ``focus_ref`` a real caller sends, not just the bare slug
(controller-qa, #138 fix round). The cost is recorded, not hidden: the
canonical prose fixture ("IGNORE-PRIOR-INSTRUCTIONS-…", 9 segments) fits
inside the real slug envelope, so no shape rule can both admit every real
slug and reject it — ref-kind fields enforce charset + length (+ a
≥11-segment prose floor) only, while every ident-kind field (actor
``user``, ``session_ref``) keeps the full shape defense below.

A second deliberate divergence from the upstream twin (#170): the ``ident``
quantifier here is TIGHTER than zeitgeist/editor.py:146's. Upstream still
declares ``{0,63}`` against its own 32-char hard max (enforced by a separate
length check) — the same pattern/maxLength self-contradiction zeitgeist#41
fixed in the relay's schemas, where a consumer deriving the bound from the
pattern alone read 64 and shipped a value the relay then rejected as
``bound``. The quantifier here declares the bound the module enforces
(``_MAX_LENGTH["ident"]``, 32); the character class is unchanged and
``ident()``'s accept set is exactly what it was — a 33..64-char ident failed
the length check before this change and fails the pattern after it.
