"""Forbidden-key sets and the client-side "forbidden-field zero-attempt" gate.

``FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_KEYS`` mirrors F3's ``FORBIDDEN_KEYS_V1``
(m1-contract-drafts/F3.md §3.1 item 2, closed, versioned, direction-agnostic,
recursive key-only walk). ``FORBIDDEN_OBSERVATION_KEYS`` mirrors F1's set
(m1-contract-drafts/F1.md §3.3). Both are bundled here as literal frozensets
— Z1 cannot import either upstream package (Z1.md §2.5, §3.2 item 3) — with a
committed version constant each, so a future drift is a deliberate,
versioned, re-pinned act rather than silent bit-rot (Z1.md §4 row N20).

``assert_clean`` is called synchronously *before* any network attempt
(Z1.md §3.2 item 8 step 2): "forbidden-field zero-attempt" means the relay's
request log stays empty when it fires, not merely that the request later
fails.

The key match is case-sensitive exact-match by design, parity-anchored to
F3's own case-sensitive forbidden-key check (F3.md §3.1 item 2) — this is a
deliberate parity choice, not an oversight, so ``{"Token": "x"}`` is not
rejected by ``FORBIDDEN_CONTROL_KEYS``/``FORBIDDEN_OBSERVATION_KEYS`` unless
the exact-cased key is present.
