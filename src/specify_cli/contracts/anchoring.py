"""Shared content-anchoring primitives for the Contract Registry (#2441 / FR-003).

This module is the promoted, ``src/``-importable home of the
``(enclosing_qualname, normalized_token_line)`` composite key that used to live
privately in ``tests/architectural/_ratchet_keys.py``. It was moved here so
production code (the registry loader/validator + the retirement absence-sweep
driver) can depend on the same DIR-041-compliant anchoring primitive that the
architectural ratchets use — ``src/`` cannot import from ``tests/``, so the
primitive had to move to ``src/``. ``tests/architectural/_ratchet_keys.py`` is
now a thin re-export shim, so every existing ratchet caller keeps importing
``composite_key`` / ``code_tokens_by_line`` / ``enclosing_qualname`` /
``composite_key_from_file`` from the same name with no behaviour change.

The composite is drift-resistant in one specific sense, and the docstrings here
promise no more than that (#3369). The key's **values** are content-derived (an
AST qualname, a tokenized code line), but the **lookup** is line-number-indexed:
``composite_key`` reads whatever line ``lineno`` names in the ``source`` it is
given. A blank/comment-line insertion is therefore survived only when (a) the
insertion is *below* the guarded site, or (b) ``lineno`` is re-derived against
the same tree — the ratchet-scan case, where the scan follows the content and
the site and the lookup shift together. Content inserted *above* a pinned,
pre-recorded ``lineno`` makes the lookup read a different line (a blank or
comment line yields the token line ``''``), so the key changes for a site that
did not semantically change — the exact failure that forced #3351's
frozen-at-authoring-SHA workaround (``tests/architectural/_home_pin_anchor.py``).
This is still the anchoring discipline DIR-041 mandates — contracts are anchored
on **content**, never on a positional ``file.py:NNN`` key — but a recorded
``lineno`` is only meaningful in the tree it was read from.

Usage
-----
::

    from specify_cli.contracts.anchoring import composite_key

    source = Path("src/foo/bar.py").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    key = composite_key(source, lineno=42)
    # returns (qualname_str, token_line_str)

Design notes
------------
* ``code_tokens_by_line`` is the tokenize-based half.  It strips STRING /
  COMMENT / whitespace tokens so docstrings and comments that merely *describe*
  a prior pattern are never treated as code.  The technique mirrors the private
  ``_code_tokens_by_line`` in ``test_no_write_side_rederivation.py``; that copy
  intentionally stays private (C-007 / the ``:295`` pin is out of scope for this
  WP).  This module is the canonical shared extraction point.

* ``enclosing_qualname`` walks the ``ast`` tree to build a dotted
  ``OuterClass.inner_func`` qualname for the innermost
  ``FunctionDef`` / ``AsyncFunctionDef`` / ``ClassDef`` whose line-range
  contains ``lineno``.  Module-level code returns ``"<module>"``.

* ``composite_key`` combines both: it returns the ``(qualname, token_line)``
  tuple that serve as the allow-list lookup key.

* ``is_file_line_anchor`` is the net-new DIR-041 guard used by the registry
  validator to REJECT any positional ``file:line`` anchor (NFR-003). Anchoring
  on ``file.py:NNN`` is precisely the rot the Contract Registry exists to
  replace, so the model must not be allowed to reintroduce it.

* Complexity is kept well below 15 (ruff C901 / Sonar S3776).

    Docstrings (``STRING`` tokens) and ``COMMENT`` tokens are excluded, so prose
    that merely *quotes* a prior pattern (e.g. a docstring documenting the old
    ``coord_branch or _current_branch`` selector) never registers as code.

    **Interpreter-independence (NFR-003).** On Python 3.11 an f-string is a single
    ``STRING`` token, so the *entire* f-string — including any ``{...}``
    interpolation — is dropped uniformly. PEP 701 (Python 3.12+) re-tokenizes
    f-strings into ``FSTRING_START`` / ``FSTRING_MIDDLE`` / ``FSTRING_END`` plus
    the interpolation's *ordinary* tokens (``{``, the expression names, ``}``),
    which are NOT ``FSTRING_*`` and would otherwise leak into the token-line
    (``pattern = { mission_slug }`` on 3.12 vs ``pattern =`` on 3.11). That makes
    the composite key — and every pinned ratchet baseline keyed off it — drift
    between local 3.11 and the CI 3.12 shard. To keep the key identical on both,
    the whole f-string interior (everything between ``FSTRING_START`` and the
    matching ``FSTRING_END``, inclusive of nesting) is dropped here, reproducing
    the 3.11 single-``STRING`` behaviour. This is a key-normalization change only:
    the set of flagged offenders and the allow-list semantics are unchanged.

    * ``token_line`` — space-joined code tokens on ``lineno`` via

    The **lookup** is line-number-indexed, not content-addressed:
    ``token_line`` is read with ``tokens.get(lineno, "")`` and ``qualname``

    Content inserted **above** a pinned, pre-recorded ``lineno`` makes the

    #3351 hit (a recorded line resolving to a comment), which is why the
