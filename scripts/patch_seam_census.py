"""AST census of ``patch()`` seams and the assertions that read them.

Mission ``sync-sleep-count-3136-01KZ9B5A``, WP03. This is the instrument behind
SC-001, SC-002 and SC-013 — and, because a census that simply *printed* the
expected table would satisfy all three, it is pinned by a committed control
fixture and a self-mutation arm in
``tests/architectural/test_patch_seam_census_control.py`` (SC-015).

**This is a reporter, not a gate.** It exits 0 on any successful analysis
regardless of what it finds. The mechanism-keyed gate is a separate deliverable.

Why the mechanism and not the string
------------------------------------
Keying on the literal ``time.sleep`` would refuse exactly one spelling. This
census keys on what ``unittest.mock._get_target`` actually does: it splits the
target on the **last** dot and imports the left half, so ``patch("a.b.c.attr")``
mutates whatever ``a.b.c`` resolves to. When that resolves to a ``ModuleType``
whose ``__name__`` **differs** from the dotted path, the patch is reaching
*through* one module to mutate a shared object owned by another — the defect
class, whatever it is spelled.

Why not the literal FR-005 predicate
------------------------------------
FR-005 as worded refuses any target whose penultimate segment resolves to a
``ModuleType``. Measured over ``tests/sync/``, that flags **649 of 664 sites
(97.7%)** — because that is simply how ``_get_target`` works, including for the
357 *correct* own-module patches. Built to the letter the gate is unshippable,
and the natural reaction is a hardcoded exclusion list, which is precisely the
vacuity the instrument exists to prevent. Every report therefore prints the
literal-predicate figure beside the narrowed buckets so the over-breadth stays
visible rather than being quietly dropped.

The narrowed discriminator is: resolved module ``__name__`` **≠** the dotted
module path (reach-through), **or** the resolved module is not first-party
(direct foreign).

The first-party boundary is a **definitional choice**, not a fact. It is derived
from ``src/``, overridable with ``--first-party-roots``, and echoed into every
``--json`` payload under ``first_party_roots`` so no report hides the definition
that produced its buckets.

Import identity
---------------
``scripts/`` has no ``__init__.py``, so it is an implicit namespace package, and
``pytest.ini`` deliberately keeps ``.`` off ``pythonpath`` to prevent one source
file being loaded under two module names. This script therefore inserts the
repository root and imports its sibling under its canonical ``scripts.`` name,
so the resolver — and its verdict enum — has exactly one module identity
regardless of entry point. There is **one** resolver, and it lives in
``check_patch_targets.py``; this file must never grow its own import walk.
