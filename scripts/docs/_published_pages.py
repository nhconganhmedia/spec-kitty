"""Single authority for "which documentation source pages are published".

That question used to have *two* answers: ``docs/docfx.json`` — which the DocFX
build follows — and a hardcoded glob list inside ``tests/docs/test_docs_seo.py``
— which the SEO gate followed. When ``how-to/`` became ``guides/`` and
``reference/slash-commands`` became ``api/``, the build followed the move and
the gate did not. The gate kept reporting green while resolving **16 of 674**
pages.

This module removes the possibility of a second list. It reads
``docs/docfx.json`` **at call time** and returns a :class:`PublishedPageSet`
that carries its own provenance (:attr:`PublishedPageSet.source_globs`) and its
own exclusion rationale (:attr:`PublishedPageSet.exclusions`), so a consuming
gate can explain *why* a page is absent instead of silently omitting it.

Two properties are load-bearing:

* **Fail-closed.** Every degraded resolution raises. There is no code path on
  which this function returns a partial set, because a silently-partial set is
  precisely the defect under repair (I-01, I-02).
* **DocFX glob semantics, not ``pathlib`` semantics.** DocFX's ``context/**.md``
  matches ``context/foo.md``; the naive translation ``context/**/*.md`` does
  not. Getting that wrong under-collects silently — the same bug wearing a new
  hat — so :func:`_docfx_glob_to_regex` is validated by membership assertions
  against known live pages rather than by reasoning (C-R5).

The leading underscore matches the existing convention for shared internal
helpers in this package (``_inventory.py``, ``_render.py``): this is a library,
not an entry point.

Depends only on the standard library.
