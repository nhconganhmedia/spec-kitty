"""Mutant: neutralise FR-009's ``reset_token_manager()`` hardening at hook level
(C-003, FR-009, #3030 / #3115).

`578a659162` / `4f8e4ca781` added a process-wide ``TokenManager`` singleton reset
to five ``#3030`` CLI test files as **self-declared unproven hardening** ("Could
not force a live reproduction of the reported empty-journal CI failure locally
... this is defensive hardening of a credible process-global per the
maintainer's lead, not a confirmed-necessary fix"). The width finding (WP02,
approved) gives a strong prior that the reset was aimed at a global that was
never the CLI cause -- but a prior is not a measurement. This mutant makes the
claim cheap to test in both directions: with it loaded, ``reset_token_manager()``
is replaced by a no-op at every one of the five call sites it can reach, so a
run under this mutant answers "does removing the reset change the outcome?"
directly, rather than by argument.

Loading (binding, C-003 §1 -- corrected contract)
----------------------------------------------------
    PYTHONPATH=scripts/mutants:$WT/src <venv>/bin/python -m pytest \\
        -p neutralise_reset_token_manager_3115 \\
        tests/cli/commands/test_sync_status_per_project_3030.py

``PYTHONPATH`` alone loads nothing: it only makes this module *importable*.
Pytest does not import every importable module on ``sys.path`` as a plugin --
only ones it is told to load. Without ``-p`` (or ``PYTEST_PLUGINS=...``) this
file is never imported, never binds, and the run reads as a passing gate while
mutating nothing. The ``-p`` flag is therefore load-bearing and MUST be quoted
in any evidence taken under this mutant (mirrors ``disable_render_seam_3115``
and ``nonterminating_dispatch_3115``, both approved precedents on this
mission).

Neutralisation site (binding, C-003 §2)
-------------------------------------------
Hook level, in ``pytest_configure`` -- **never** a same-named fixture. All five
``578a659162`` files import ``reset_token_manager`` **function-locally, inside
the fixture body, from the defining module** ``specify_cli.auth.manager``
(measured: ``test_sync_doctor_per_project_3030.py:62``,
``test_sync_status_per_project_3030.py:73``,
``test_sync_migrate_backfills_h4.py:57``, ``test_sync_purge_3030.py:83``,
``test_sync_doctor_consent_health_3030.py:70``), so this module patches the
**production attribute** ``specify_cli.auth.manager.reset_token_manager``
directly at ``pytest_configure`` -- before any fixture body runs -- rather than
shadowing a fixture. Each fixture's function-local ``from
specify_cli.auth.manager import reset_token_manager`` re-resolves the name off
the module *at call time* (one ``IMPORT_FROM`` + ``STORE_FAST`` per fixture
invocation, same fact ``nonterminating_dispatch_3115`` verified with ``dis``
for its own function-local import), so it picks up whichever object the module
attribute holds at the moment the fixture runs -- which, once
``pytest_configure`` has replaced it, is this mutant's no-op.

This is deliberately **not** the ``pytest_fixture_setup``-interception shape
``disable_render_seam_3115`` uses: that mutant neutralises a named *fixture*
(``tests.conftest._plain_cli_console_seam``), where a same-named plugin
fixture would lose to the conftest fixture for items under that conftest's
directory. There is no fixture named ``reset_token_manager`` to collide with --
it is a plain function imported and called inline -- so patching the
**production module attribute it is imported from** is both sufficient and the
correct site, the same shape ``nonterminating_dispatch_3115`` uses for
``specify_cli.delivery.dispatcher.dispatch``.

Per-site split (binding, C-003 §3 -- mandatory, shape already measured)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A single aggregate suppressed count cannot distinguish "all five mutated" from
"one mutated, four inert" (the mission's fifth rot mode). Every call this
mutant intercepts is attributed to its caller's frame -- the fixture body that
invoked ``reset_token_manager()`` -- by that frame's source file basename, and
counted **per site** against the five known basenames:

    test_sync_doctor_per_project_3030.py
    test_sync_status_per_project_3030.py
    test_sync_migrate_backfills_h4.py
    test_sync_purge_3030.py
    test_sync_doctor_consent_health_3030.py

Two other sites bind ``reset_token_manager`` **eagerly by value** at module
import, via the package name rather than the defining module --
``tests/auth/integration/conftest.py:22`` and
``tests/auth/test_websocket_provisioning.py:28``, both
``from specify_cli.auth import reset_token_manager``. ``specify_cli/auth/__init__.py:44``
re-exports the symbol with the same shape
(``from .manager import get_token_manager, reset_token_manager``), which binds
a **name in the ``specify_cli.auth`` package's own namespace** to whatever
object ``specify_cli.auth.manager.reset_token_manager`` held at the moment
``specify_cli.auth`` was first imported -- not a live reference to the
submodule attribute this mutant patches. Patching
``specify_cli.auth.manager.reset_token_manager`` therefore does **not** reach
either of those two sites (the fifth rot mode named in the mission's own
standing rules: "``from X import f`` rebinds by value"). They are **outside
this WP's cone** (``tests/auth/**`` is "nobody's" per the WP brief) and are
**deliberately left unpatched** -- this mutant's report names them explicitly,
by path, and never folds them into the numeric split as a zero, which would
misreport "attempted and inert" where the truth is "never attempted."

Self-proof (binding, C-003 §3)
-----------------------------------
1. **Binding assertion.** ``pytest_configure`` imports
   ``specify_cli.auth.manager`` and asserts ``reset_token_manager`` is present
   under that exact name and callable. Absent, renamed or relocated -> loud
   failure (``pytest.UsageError``) before the session runs; no test result
   from this run may be trusted (mirrors both precedents' configure-time
   contract).
2. **Per-site split, reported by name.** See above; the report distinguishes
   the five patched sites from the two named-but-deliberately-unpatched ones,
   never conflating them.
3. **Loud failure on zero suppressions.** If the sum of the five per-site
   counts is zero at session end, that is a finding about the mutant (wrong
   node-ids selected, binding failed silently, or the patched attribute was
   genuinely unreached this session), never a finding about the reset under
   test, and no verdict may be drawn from such a run (C-003, standing-rules.md
   rot-mode #4). Reported via a forced non-zero ``session.exitstatus`` plus a
   bold/red terminal line rather than a raise from ``pytest_sessionfinish`` --
   ``nonterminating_dispatch_3115`` measured that raising from that hook (or
   from the ``pytest_terminal_summary`` its own sessionfinish sibling is
   called from) propagates as an uncaught traceback that pre-empts
   ``TerminalReporter.summary_stats()``, destroying the final ``N
   passed/failed in Ys`` count line -- exactly the evidence NFR-003 says is
   load-bearing, for exactly the run meant to prove there is none. The same
   non-raising shape is used here for the same measured reason.

Reporting (binding, C-003 §4)
----------------------------------
``pytest_terminal_summary`` prints the per-site suppression split (five named
sites plus the two deliberately-unpatched ones, by path) so it can be quoted
beside the run's own count line and collected count. Every load-bearing quote
of a run under this mutant MUST include this report, not just "ran under the
mutant, still green" or "still red."

What the replacement does, and why
---------------------------------------
The real ``reset_token_manager`` (``src/specify_cli/auth/manager.py:34-41``)
does exactly one thing: ``global _tm; with _tm_lock: _tm = None`` -- drop the
cached singleton so the next ``get_token_manager()`` call constructs a fresh
one. This mutant's replacement does **nothing at all**: it does not touch
``_tm``, does not acquire ``_tm_lock``, and returns ``None`` (matching the real
function's return annotation) after recording the call for the per-site
report. Whatever ``TokenManager`` instance a prior test in the same worker
process left cached therefore survives, untouched, into whichever of the five
``578a659162`` files' tests run next in that process -- which is exactly the
leak the original hardening's docstring describes as its threat model. If that
threat model is real, a discriminating case turns red under this mutant; if it
does not, that is the measurement, not an assumption.

Known limits of the per-site attribution (noted, not currently load-bearing)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The per-site split keys on the caller's frame filename by **basename only**
(see ``_neutralised_reset_token_manager``), so two same-named test files in
different directories would conflate into one bucket. None of this mission's
five sites collide by basename with anything else in the tree today. The
per-site counters are also plain module-level globals, scoped to one plugin
instance in one interpreter process: under ``xdist`` each worker loads its
own copy of this plugin and prints its own report independently, with no
cross-worker aggregation. Neither limit bites the measurements this WP took
(single-process, no ``-n``/``--dist``, per C-004), and both are recorded here
so a future user of this plugin under a different invocation shape does not
inherit them silently.
