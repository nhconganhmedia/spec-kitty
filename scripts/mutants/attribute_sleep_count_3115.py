"""Mutant: attribute every mocked ``time.sleep`` call to its calling thread
and its patch site (C-003, FR-005, #3115).

WP06's floor (T020) tried ten selections against
``tests/sync/tracker/test_saas_client.py::TestRetryBehaviors::test_429_respects_retry_after``
and reproduced the reported ``AssertionError: Expected 'sleep' to be called
once. Called <n> times.`` in **none** of them (see the WP06 report /
``notes/`` for the full enumeration with collected counts). This mutant does
not try to force that reproduction again -- it instruments the *mechanism*
FR-005 already established as given, so that **if** an extra call ever does
land on a ``time.sleep`` mock in this cone, this run can say *which thread*
made it, rather than only that the tally moved.

Why the target is ``(time, sleep)``, not an import site
---------------------------------------------------------
``src/specify_cli/tracker/saas_client.py:19`` is a bare ``import time``, so
``specify_cli.tracker.saas_client.time`` **is** the stdlib ``time`` module
object -- not a separate name bound to it. Every ``@patch("<anything>.time.sleep")``
in the tree, regardless of which module's dotted path is used to reach it,
resolves ``getter()`` to that same module object and patches the same
``sleep`` attribute on it. This is the **opposite** shape from
``neutralise_reset_token_manager_3115``'s fifth-rot-mode target (``from X
import f`` rebinds by value, producing genuinely independent references) --
here there is structurally only ONE object being patched, ever, however many
dotted strings name it. So "the per-site split across every name the symbol
is reachable by" (C-003 contract) is reported here as the **distinct
``@patch(...)`` target strings** actually entered this session (the "site"
dimension the contract asks for), crossed with the **calling thread name**
(the dimension this specific investigation needs) -- not an import-rebind
census, because there is no rebinding to census.

Loading (binding, C-003 §1 -- corrected contract)
----------------------------------------------------
    PYTHONPATH=scripts/mutants <venv>/bin/python -m pytest \\
        -p attribute_sleep_count_3115 \\
        tests/sync/tracker/test_saas_client.py

``PYTHONPATH`` alone loads nothing: it only makes this module *importable*.
Pytest does not import every importable module on ``sys.path`` as a plugin --
only ones it is told to load. Without ``-p`` (or ``PYTEST_PLUGINS=...``) this
file is never imported, never binds, and the run reads as a passing gate
while instrumenting nothing. The ``-p`` flag is therefore load-bearing and
MUST be quoted in any evidence taken under this mutant (mirrors
``disable_render_seam_3115`` and ``neutralise_reset_token_manager_3115``,
both approved precedents on this mission).

**Binding, serial-only (round 2, measured).** This mutant's module-level
dicts (``_activations_by_site``, ``_calls_by_site_thread``) live in **one
Python process**. Under ``-n auto`` / ``-n <N> --dist loadfile``, pytest-xdist
runs each worker (``gw0``, ``gw1``, ...) as a **separate OS process**, each
with its own import of this module and its own empty dicts; nothing merges
them back to the controller process that prints
``pytest_terminal_summary``. Measured twice: a 53-test file at
``-n 2 --dist loadfile`` gave ``53 passed`` but
``activations per site: {}``, ``total recorded calls: 0``, exit status 1, no
``VERDICT`` banner content; a full ``tests/sync/`` run at
``-n auto --dist loadfile`` (16 workers) gave ``3 failed, 2367 passed, 18
skipped`` with the identical empty-report shape. Both runs' individual tests
still passed or failed correctly -- the *tests'* own mocks worked per-worker
-- only this mutant's **aggregate report** is structurally empty under xdist.
**Serial mode (no ``-n``) is required for this mutant's report to mean
anything**; it recorded 11 real activations there in round 1's mechanism
proof. Cheap per-worker aggregation (e.g. writing each worker's dicts to a
per-``gw<N>`` file at ``pytest_sessionfinish`` and reconciling them in a
follow-up pass) is possible but not built here -- this caveat is the binding
substitute.

Instrumentation site (binding, C-003 §2)
-------------------------------------------
Hook level, in ``pytest_configure`` -- **never** a same-named fixture. There
is no fixture named ``time.sleep`` to shadow; the thing being intercepted is
``unittest.mock._patch.__enter__`` itself, which every ``@patch(...)``
decorator and every ``with patch(...):`` block calls to perform the patch
(the decorator form calls it via ``_patch.start()``, which calls
``__enter__``; both paths go through this one method). This module wraps
``unittest.mock._patch.__enter__`` at ``pytest_configure`` -- before any test
collects or runs -- so every patch entered for the rest of the session,
across every test file selected, passes through the wrapper. The wrapper
calls the real ``__enter__`` first and only acts on the result when
``self.attribute == "sleep"`` and the resolved target module's ``__name__``
is ``"time"`` -- every other patch (``httpx.Client``, ``time.monotonic``,
``_force_refresh_sync``, ...) passes through completely untouched.

Non-destructive by construction: if the matched mock already has a
non-``None``, non-callable ``side_effect`` at the moment this wrapper
inspects it (e.g. ``patch(..., side_effect=some_list_or_exception)``, a shape
used outside this WP's ownership --
``tests/sync/test_final_sync_diagnostics.py:260`` patches
``specify_cli.sync.batch.time.sleep`` this way), this mutant does **not**
touch it: the activation is recorded (the site is seen) but call-attribution
is skipped for that one mock, named in the report as "seen, not
instrumented" rather than silently folded into the counted totals or, worse,
silently corrupting an unrelated test's behavior. Where the existing
``side_effect`` is callable (or absent), this mutant wraps it: its own
recorder runs first, then the original callable runs (chained), so the
underlying test's own semantics are preserved bit-for-bit -- only the
recording is added.

Self-proof (binding, C-003 §3 -- all three mandatory)
------------------------------------------------------
1. **Binding assertion.** ``pytest_configure`` imports ``unittest.mock`` and
   asserts ``_patch.__enter__`` is present and callable before wrapping it.
   Absent, renamed or relocated -> loud failure (``pytest.UsageError``)
   *before* the session runs; no test result from this run may be trusted.
2. **Per-site split, reported by name.** Every matching patch activation is
   attributed to the exact string passed to ``patch(...)`` (reconstructed
   from ``self.getter.args[0] + "." + self.attribute`` -- ``self.getter`` is
   ``functools.partial(pkgutil.resolve_name, "<module-path>")`` per
   ``unittest.mock._get_target``), and every recorded call is attributed to
   that site **and** to ``threading.current_thread().name``. The report
   prints both the per-site activation counts and the full
   ``(site, thread) -> call count`` table, never a bare aggregate integer,
   per C-003's fifth rot mode ("a single aggregate count cannot distinguish
   'both sites mutated' from 'one mutated, one inert'") -- restated here for
   the thread dimension this investigation actually needs: a single
   aggregate call count cannot distinguish "all calls came from the test's
   own thread" from "some calls came from a leaked thread," which is
   precisely FR-005's open question.
3. **Loud failure if the symbol it patched was never called.** If the sum of
   every recorded call across every site is zero at session end -- whether
   because no test in this run ever entered a matching patch, or because one
   was entered but the mock was never invoked -- that is a finding about the
   run's selection (wrong node-ids, or the patched attribute genuinely
   unreached), never a finding about FR-005's mechanism, and no verdict may
   be drawn from it. Reported via a forced non-zero ``session.exitstatus``
   plus a bold/red terminal line rather than a raise from
   ``pytest_sessionfinish`` -- ``nonterminating_dispatch_3115`` measured
   that raising from that hook (or from ``pytest_terminal_summary``, its own
   ``sessionfinish`` sibling calls it from) propagates as an uncaught
   traceback that pre-empts ``TerminalReporter.summary_stats()``, destroying
   the final ``N passed/failed in Ys`` count line -- exactly the evidence
   NFR-003 says is load-bearing, for exactly the run meant to prove there is
   none. The same non-raising shape is used here for the same measured
   reason.

Reporting (binding, C-003 §4)
----------------------------------
``pytest_terminal_summary`` prints the per-site activation counts, the full
``(site, thread)`` call table, and the per-thread totals, so they can be
quoted beside the run's own count line. Every load-bearing quote of a run
under this mutant MUST include this report, not just "ran under the mutant,
thread X showed up."

Call-stack attribution (round 2 -> round 3 addition)
------------------------------------------------------
A thread *name* is not a call site: most leaked worker/daemon threads in
this tree are unnamed (``threading.Thread(target=...).start()`` with no
``name=``), so every one of them reports as ``"Thread-N"`` or, when the
intruder is a background ``.wait()`` running synchronously on a thread that
was itself started without a name, indistinguishable from any other. To
name the actual call site, ``_recorder`` captures
``traceback.extract_stack()`` on the first ``_MAX_STACK_SAMPLES_PER_KEY``
(5) calls for each ``(site, thread)`` key and reports the **modal**
signature -- the most common stack shape among the samples -- because a
busy-wait loop (this mutant's whole reason for existing: FR-005's own
established mechanism is a *loop* re-entering ``time.sleep`` from the same
source line every iteration) produces near-identical stacks call after
call, so even 5 samples reliably name it. Capped, not unconditional:
measured independently that a single ``Popen.wait(timeout=0.2)`` produces
tens of thousands of calls in one patch window, so capturing on every call
would make this mutant itself the bottleneck.

    MEASURED DEFECT, fixed here -- the xdist controller/worker state split
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The recorders run, and so the counters increment, ONLY inside the worker
    that owns the test; this verdict runs ONLY on the controller, whose
    counters are permanently 0. Uncorrected, EVERY ``-n`` run reported
    ``recorded ZERO calls`` and forced exit 1. Measured: a 3-test selection
    whose first test enters a ``(time, sleep)`` patch and calls it twice gave
    ``total activations: 1, total recorded calls: 2``, exit 0 serially -- and
    ``total activations: 0, total recorded calls: 0`` plus the NO VERDICT line
    and exit 1 under ``-n 2``, on the same passing selection. A worker's
    ``session.exitstatus`` mutation is discarded by xdist, so the counters
    themselves travel via ``config.workeroutput`` (workers only) and are
    merged on the controller in ``pytest_testnodedown``.

    ``neutralise_reset_token_manager_3115``'s docstrings for the measured
    reason: a raise from this hook (or from ``pytest_terminal_summary``)
    propagates as an uncaught traceback that pre-empts
    ``TerminalReporter.summary_stats()`` and destroys the final count line,
    which would defeat NFR-003's "the count line is the evidence" rule for
