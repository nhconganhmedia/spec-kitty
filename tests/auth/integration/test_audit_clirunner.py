"""CliRunner-usage audit (WP11 T063) + legacy-class audit (WP11 T064).

These tests are **meta-tests** over the ``tests/auth/integration/`` tree
itself. They enforce the two hard rejection criteria from the WP11
prompt:

(T063) Every integration test must drive the real Typer app via
:class:`typer.testing.CliRunner` (or :mod:`subprocess`). Direct
instantiation of flow classes — ``AuthorizationCodeFlow``,
``DeviceCodeFlow``, ``BrowserLoginFlow`` — is forbidden in integration
tests. A file that imports a flow class without also importing
CliRunner or subprocess signals a bad test (probably a lifted unit
test pretending to be an integration test).

(T064) No integration test may reference the deleted legacy classes
``AuthClient`` or ``CredentialStore``. This catches a future
regression where someone copies an old WP-era test into ``integration/``
without rewriting it against :func:`get_token_manager`.

These audits intentionally grep **text**, not AST: if a comment or
docstring contains the forbidden name, that is still a violation
because it signals confusion about the contract.

Exceptions:
- :mod:`test_audit_clirunner` (this file) is audit code and does not
  drive the CLI — it is explicitly exempted from the CliRunner rule.
- :mod:`test_transport_rewired` uses :mod:`inspect` to scan source and
  does not drive the CLI either — exempted from the CliRunner rule.
- :mod:`conftest` is fixtures, not a test file, so it is exempted.
