"""NFR-005 perf regression harness: ``spec-kitty agent tasks status`` p95 latency.

Mission ``charter-sole-door-bypass-closure-01KZ3WAA`` WP02 migrates the two
direct ``AgentProfileRepository()`` construction sites in
``tasks_status_cmd.py`` (the dashboard status-icon renderer at lines 712/823)
onto the charter-mediated factory. Those two sites carried a "boundary
ratchet" comment naming construction cost as the reason they bypassed the
factory; R3 (``research.md``) confirms the ratchet concern itself is a red
herring against the existing import-scanning gate (both old and new
construction are function-local), but leaves construction *cost* as the real,
previously-unmeasured risk. This file is the falsifiable measurement NFR-005
requires.

**Verdict**: a controlled, back-to-back A/B (old vs. new ``tasks_status_cmd.py``,
same process/session, no other work interleaved) puts the migrated code
within ~2% of the pre-migration baseline on both p95 and mean — well inside
the 10% NFR-005 budget. An earlier, less-controlled before/after attempt
(measurements taken ~20 minutes apart, with unrelated work and concurrent
sibling-lane test runs in between) showed an apparent ~70% regression that
did NOT reproduce under a clean A/B; that was OS-disk-cache coldness plus
system-wide CPU contention from other agents' concurrent test runs, not the
code change. Both the confounded attempt and the clean, controlling series
are recorded raw (not just derived p95 constants) in
``kitty-specs/charter-sole-door-bypass-closure-01KZ3WAA/traces/
tooling-friction.md`` so a reviewer can recompute independently and see why
the first signal was discarded rather than hidden.

Run locally::

    UV_PYTHON=3.13.9 uv run --no-sync pytest tests/perf/test_tasks_status_baseline.py -q

Outside the default CI pytest selectors (like ``test_loader_perf.py``'s NFR
tests) — this is a developer-runnable regression guard, not a CI gate.
