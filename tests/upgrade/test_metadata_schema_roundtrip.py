"""T011 — ``ProjectMetadata`` round-trips ``spec_kitty.schema_version`` (#3334).

Root cause (see ``tests/upgrade/test_failed_upgrade_recoverable.py`` for the
end-to-end reproduction): ``ProjectMetadata.save()`` used to rebuild
``metadata.yaml`` from a fixed three-key ``spec_kitty`` dict that never
included ``schema_version`` — the field was written *only* by a separate,
success-path-gated ``_stamp_schema_version`` helper in
``specify_cli.upgrade.runner``. Any ``save()`` call that ran outside that
narrow success path (a failed-migration record, ``normalize_and_save_legacy_ids``,
``doctor``/regeneration flows, ...) silently stripped ``schema_version`` from
disk, reclassifying the project as ``LEGACY`` and blocking every non-exempt
command with no way back in.

The fix (#3334, C-008) makes ``schema_version`` an ordinary round-tripped
field: ``load()`` reads it into ``ProjectMetadata.schema_version`` and
``save()`` writes it back whenever it is not ``None``. These tests pin that
round-trip directly against ``ProjectMetadata``, independent of the
migration runner.
