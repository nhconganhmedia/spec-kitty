"""T012 — replacement for the #3334 red-first repro (canonical marks, guard
docstring). REPLACES ``tests/regression/test_issue_3334_failed_upgrade_wedges_repair.py``,
which pinned the wrong contract (that a missing ``schema_version`` combined
with 3.x ``migrations.applied`` history should not classify ``LEGACY`` — i.e.
it asked ``compat/planner.py`` to change, which C-004 forbids) and would have
stayed perma-red under this WP's actual (root-cause) fix.

Open P0: https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/3334

Root cause (verified live, see ``metadata.py``): ``ProjectMetadata.save()``
rebuilt ``metadata.yaml`` from a fixed dict that never included
``schema_version`` -- the field survived only via a separate,
success-path-gated ``_stamp_schema_version`` helper. A *failed* migration
still runs ``_record_migration_result`` -> ``metadata.save()`` to persist the
failure record, which silently stripped ``schema_version`` from disk. Because
``ProjectMetadata.has_migration()`` ignores ``"failed"`` records, re-running
``spec-kitty upgrade`` just re-attempts (and re-fails) the same migration
forever, so the schema stamp is never restored: a project with real 3.x
history gets permanently misclassified alongside a genuinely-never-migrated
pre-3.x project, and every non-exempt command is blocked (exit 4) with no way
back in.

Fix (#3334, C-008): ``ProjectMetadata`` round-trips ``schema_version`` like
any other field, so the failure-recording ``save()`` can no longer strip it.

Two starting fixtures, not one
-------------------------------
The WP's four required assertions do not all hold on a single fixture, and
this was verified empirically (not assumed) against the real
``compat.planner.decide()`` truth table:

* ``compat.planner.decide()`` Row 3 blocks **any** UNSAFE command
  (``"plan"`` included -- it is unregistered in the safety registry, so it
  fails closed to UNSAFE) whenever ``ProjectState`` is ``STALE`` *or*
  ``LEGACY``. Both states hit the exact same row. So a fixture whose
  ``schema_version`` is genuinely STALE (``< MIN_SUPPORTED_SCHEMA``, i.e.
  non-``REQUIRED``) will legitimately keep blocking ``"plan"`` after the
  fix too -- that block is *correct*, unrelated gate behaviour (a project
  that really is behind on schema really should not run a mutating command
  before migrating), not the #3334 wedge.
* The bug's *practical, realistic* shape is a project that was already at
  ``REQUIRED_SCHEMA_VERSION`` (``COMPATIBLE``) getting knocked down to
  ``LEGACY`` by an unrelated failed migration. That is exactly where "does
  the gate stop blocking after the fix" is a real, RED-before/GREEN-after
  question -- and it was confirmed RED against the pre-fix code before this
  test was written (metadata.py stashed, script rerun: pre-fix
  ``get_project_schema_version`` -> ``None`` and
  ``check_schema_version(root, "plan")`` -> ``SystemExit(4)``; post-fix ->
  ``3`` / no exit).

So: ``test_failed_migration_preserves_stale_schema_version`` pins the
load-bearing, non-fakeable *preservation* guarantee (assertion 1) against a
genuinely STALE, non-``REQUIRED`` value, and separately proves the STALE
project is blocked *no worse* than an equivalent project that never
experienced a failure (not further degraded into ``LEGACY``/``CORRUPT``).
``test_failed_migration_on_compatible_project_keeps_gate_passable`` pins the
literal "gate does not raise" guarantee (assertion 2) against the realistic
COMPATIBLE-starting-point scenario where it is actually RED before the fix.
