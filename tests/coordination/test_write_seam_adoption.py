"""Tests for ``coordination.write_seam`` (WP03 / T010 / T013).

Covers the two cross-cutting contracts every Lane-C writer (WP04/05/07/10)
inherits from this foundation:

- **FR-011 zero-write refusal**: an unroutable target (missing coord surface,
  deleted ``target_branch``, or any other mission-resolution failure) returns
  a structured, recoverable ``"refused"`` result disclosing #3033 -- NEVER a
  fallback write, NEVER a raised exception, and (proven directly)
  ``commit_for_mission`` is never even invoked, so literally nothing is
  written.
- **FR-012 idempotent, structured result**: a re-run with an unchanged
  artifact is a no-op (``"unchanged"``), inherited from
  ``commit_for_mission``'s own idempotence contract.
- **Ledger-M16 recursion guard**: the write boundary resolves via
  ``PlacementSeam.write_target`` and never calls ``PlacementSeam.read_dir`` --
  the read and write authorities are never conflated at this seam.
