"""WP08 T030 — solo PR-bound coord mission: read == write, killed by construction.

#2533: a solo (no-lanes) PR-bound ``--start-branch`` mission is forced onto
``MissionTopology.COORD`` by the (frozen, out-of-scope) ``if pr_bound: return
COORD`` derivation (#2581,
``test_create_pr_bound_on_non_primary_branch_still_defaults_to_coord``) even
though no lane worktree will ever write to the minted coordination branch.
Its coordination worktree ROOT gets materialized (``ensure_coordination_branch``
mints the branch; a first ``BookkeepingTransaction.acquire()`` — or an operator
running ``spec-kitty doctor workspaces --fix`` — materializes the worktree root)
but its mission dir never does, because nothing ever appends a status event
there. ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor``'s ``CoordState.EMPTY`` arm
(WP08 T029) now routes this EXPECTED state to PRIMARY without warning.

This module is the **D4 same-path agreement regression**
(``kitty-specs/loop-friction-quickwins-2-01KXBWA4/tasks/WP08-solo-coord-
surface-routing.md``, "WP07 <-> WP08 boundary rule" item 3): it proves the fix
does not merely mute the READ-side warning while a write silently drifts to a
coordination branch nobody reads from again (the highest-listed WP08 risk —
"muting the READ warning while the WRITE still targets coord would MASK the
split-brain"). Four assertions, each load-bearing:

1. **READ surface** (:func:`resolve_status_surface`) resolves to the PRIMARY
   ``status.events.jsonl`` path — the WP08 T029 fix.
2. **WRITE commit-ref** (``mission_runtime.placement_seam(...)
   .write_target(MissionArtifactKind.STATUS_STATE)`` — the ONE kind-aware
   write-placement authority, contracts/seam-api.md; read here, never
   mutated) is READ and PINNED explicitly rather than ignored: for
   ``MissionTopology.COORD`` it is (by frozen, out-of-scope design,
   ``coordination/status_transition.py:_resolve_write_target``'s own
   docstring — "STATUS write target MUST keep resolving the coordination
   branch under coord topology") the coordination branch, NOT
   ``target_branch``. This is asserted OPENLY, not hidden, so a reviewer
   sees exactly what WP08 does and does not change.
3. **No-masking proof**: at this legitimate-empty moment the coordination
   branch has NOT diverged from ``target_branch`` — same commit SHA. Nothing
   has ever been committed to the coordination branch that the PRIMARY
   fallback could be silently hiding; a real mismatch (assertion 3 failing)
   would mean data exists on coordination that reads never surface — exactly
   the masked split-brain the WP08 risk note warns against.
4. **Self-healing regression**: once a real write lands under the coord
   worktree (mirroring ``BookkeepingTransaction.append_event()``'s
   ``feature_dir.mkdir()``), ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor``
   immediately tracks it there (``CoordState.MATERIALIZED``) — the EMPTY-arm
   quiet-primary routing is a live, self-correcting reflection of on-disk
   state, never a cached/stale answer that could keep masking a write after
   one actually happens.

Fixture data mirrors ``tests/mission_runtime/test_placement_seam.py`` (real
git repo, real 26-char ULID ``mission_id``, canonical coordination-branch
naming via ``specify_cli.missions._create.coordination_branch_name`` —
realistic test data, no synthetic short IDs).
