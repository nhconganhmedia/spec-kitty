"""Regression test for issue #101: CLI startup crash on non-UTF-8 Windows code pages.

The root cause was that printing non-ASCII characters (e.g. path separators with
accented names, emoji in banners) would raise ``UnicodeEncodeError`` when
``sys.stdout`` was using a legacy code page such as Windows-1252 (cp1252).

The fix calls ``ensure_utf8_on_windows()`` at CLI import time (T046), which
reconfigures stdout/stderr to UTF-8 with ``errors='replace'``. This test
reproduces the crash class by running a subprocess under an explicit legacy
code page and asserting exit code 0.

Marked ``@pytest.mark.windows_ci`` — runs only on the ``windows-latest`` CI
job (skipped on POSIX CI runners via the ``-m "not windows_ci"`` filter).

Spec IDs: FR-016, FR-017, SC-004
