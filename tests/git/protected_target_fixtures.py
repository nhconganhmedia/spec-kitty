"""Reusable real-git-repo fixtures for the commit-guard protection suite.

Mission ``tooling-stability-guard-coherence-01KTRC04`` (WP01, ATDD-first).
Updated WP01 of ``specify-protected-primary-coherence-01KVMBD6`` (T005 self-check).

These fixtures build **real** git repositories under ``tmp_path`` — no mocks,
following 01KTPKST's mutation-tested precedent. Two things matter for the
commit guard to actually engage (debugger-debby RISK-5):

1. The repo must look like a spec-kitty project — ``_is_spec_kitty_project``
   returns ``True`` only when a ``.kittify/`` directory exists. Without it
   ``assert_not_protected_branch`` short-circuits and the guard is *skipped
   entirely*. The :class:`ProtectedTargetRepo` fixture asserts this precondition
   on itself so a future refactor cannot silently neuter the suite.
2. The target branch must be in the guard's protected set. With no remote
   configured, the resolved set is ``{"main", "master"}`` (NFR-004), so a
   repo whose HEAD is ``main`` is protected hermetically (no network).

T005 verification (WP01 / NFR-004)
-----------------------------------
``assert_target_is_protected`` calls ``commit_helpers.protected_branches()``
which is now a public delegate of
``ProtectionPolicy.resolve(repo_path).protected_branches`` (T002).  The
delegate is intentionally kept public so this fixture and the FR-010 allowlist
continue to work unchanged.  A repo with no ``protection:`` config block yields
``{main, master}`` — byte-identical to the pre-WP01 behaviour (NFR-004).

The :class:`ProtectedTargetRepo` dataclass is exported for WP05's SC-6 e2e
(``specify -> plan -> tasks -> finalize-tasks`` on a protected target). It is
deterministic and tmp-scoped — it leaks no ``test-feature-*`` mission state.
