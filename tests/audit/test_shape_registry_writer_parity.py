"""Anti-drift guard for the ``meta.json`` audit shape registry (#2696, FR-011 / NFR-004).

The audit registry's ``meta.json`` known-key set MUST be derived from the
canonical mission-metadata writer schema (``MissionMetaRequired`` +
``MissionMetaOptional``) plus the coordination write-path keys — never a
hand-rolled second copy that can silently drift and start reporting canonical
keys as ``UNKNOWN_SHAPE`` false positives.

These tests fail loudly the moment the writer schema grows a field the audit
registry does not know about, so the two can never re-diverge (NFR-004).
