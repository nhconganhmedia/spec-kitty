"""FIX-M2-15 acceptance criterion 3: a REAL-container contract proof that
the bundled Zeitgeist client's two-credential fix (``transport.
ClientConfig.capability_credential`` / ``filtered_stream.TeamStreamConfig.
relay_token``) actually closes the gap DQA-M2-05 found -- not against this
package's own recording/protocol-faithful doubles (``conftest.py``'s
``ManagedControlDouble``/``ManagedStreamAuthDouble``), but against the
REAL, unmodified ``dkr-m1-02-zeitgeist:contract`` image, provisioned
EXACTLY the way ``spec-kitty-saas``'s own per-team relay driver
(``apps.live_capability.provisioning_docker.DockerProvisioningDriver.
provision``) provisions a real team's deployment: a freshly-generated,
INDEPENDENT ``ZEITGEIST_TOKEN`` (the shared ``Authorization`` bearer) and
``ZEITGEIST_CAPABILITY_KEY`` (the HMAC signing key for per-actor
``X-Zeitgeist-Capability`` JWTs) -- never the same value doing double duty,
the exact shape FIX-M2-10/FIX-M2-13's own test suites never exercised (see
``test_transport.py``/``test_filtered_stream.py``'s own FIX-M2-15
regression-pin tests for the same proof against the local doubles).

Gated and SKIPPED BY DEFAULT, mirroring
``spec-kitty-saas``'s ``apps/live_capability/tests/
test_provisioning_docker_local.py`` own discipline (same image, same
"only runs when `docker` is on PATH AND the image already exists locally,
never pulled" gate): only runs when both are true on this host. Every
container/volume/network this module creates is ``zg-fix15-*``-prefixed
and torn down in a module-scoped fixture's teardown, never
``dkr-m1-03-*``/``zg-tenant-*`` -- a live DKR-M1-03 stack or a
concurrently-running spec-kitty-saas Docker-local suite, if either happens
to be up on this host, is never read, started, or stopped by this file.

The REAL, unmodified ``specify_cli.zeitgeist_client.transport.
ZeitgeistClient.offer()``/``filtered_stream.FilteredStream.watch()`` are
what run here -- no test-only wire-shape helper stands in for either (the
one exception, ``mint_capability_token`` from this package's own
``conftest.py``, mints the CALLER's own capability JWT the way a real
issuer -- ``apps.live_capability.relay_auth.mint_relay_token`` in
production -- would; it is not a stand-in for anything this test exercises
on the RECEIVING end, which is the real, unmodified relay).
