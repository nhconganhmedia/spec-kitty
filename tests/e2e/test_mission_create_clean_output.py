"""E2E contract test for ``agent mission create --json`` clean output.

This test verifies the FR-008 / FR-009 contract IN-PROCESS rather than
shelling out to the installed ``spec-kitty`` binary, because the
installed CLI in the agent's PATH may be the previous release without
WP06's fixes (an upgrade race that would make subprocess-based tests
flake).

The contract has observable invariants:

1. The JSON success path of ``agent mission create`` calls
   ``mark_invocation_succeeded()`` AFTER the final JSON write.
2. Repeated diagnostics within one invocation are gated by
   ``report_once(...)`` so a second call does not log.

(Invariant 3 of the original set — structured non-fatal final-sync shutdown
diagnostics — died with the sync transport's ``BackgroundSyncService``, issue
#5.)

We verify each of these in the smallest in-process way that proves the
operator-visible contract holds, without depending on the installed
binary version or the network.
