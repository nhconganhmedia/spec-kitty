"""WP05 (T026) — coord-deleted convergence contract: all three legs hard-fail.

Mission ``mission-surface-resolver-safety-net-01KVN754`` WP05 drains the last
equivalence-gate cells by converging the **coord-deleted** topology onto ONE loud
hard-fail. A coordination branch declared in ``meta.json`` but DELETED from git,
with no coord worktree on disk, is *data loss* (#1848 / FR-005) — never a silent
stale-primary read. After WP05 every read-side resolution leg raises the SAME
distinct type and ``error_code``:

* ``missions._read_path_resolver.resolve_handle_to_read_path`` (``require_exists=True``)
  — T022 read-path fold (probe ``DELETED`` arm → hard-fail).
* ``coordination.surface_resolver.resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`` — the
  canonical surface (already hard-failed ``DELETED`` pre-WP05).
* ``status.aggregate.MissionStatus.load`` — T023: the aggregate now propagates the
  deleted-branch type VERBATIM via a more-specific ``except`` AHEAD of the
  ``StatusReadPathNotFound`` → ``CoordAuthorityUnavailable`` re-wrap.

All three must raise :class:`CoordinationBranchDeleted` with
``error_code == "COORDINATION_BRANCH_DELETED"``. Production-shaped identity: a real
26-char ULID (Mission Identity Model 083+), the first 8 chars as the ``mid8``
disambiguator, and the real on-disk ``kitty-specs/<slug>-<mid8>/`` layout.
