"""ATDD: uninitialized canonical-status error must name a dependency cycle.

Regression test for upstream #1589 (facet 1): when ``finalize-tasks`` aborts on a
circular WP dependency, canonical status is never bootstrapped, so downstream
``move-task``/``next`` raise "no canonical status, run finalize-tasks". That hint
loops forever because finalize keeps aborting on the same cycle. The error must
instead surface the dependency cycle as the actionable root cause.

These tests are RED before the fix (the helper does not exist) and GREEN after.
