"""WP03 (T012-T015, FR-008): the verdict-durability write at the emit seam.

Contract: ``kitty-specs/verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35/contracts/
verdict-durability-write.md`` -- ``status/emit.py::emit_status_transition``'s
event-log append is THE authoritative durable act for a recorded verdict
(any outbound-from-``in_review`` transition, which the FSM requires to carry
a ``ReviewResult``). The ``review-cycle-N.md`` artifact commit
(``review/cycle.py::_commit_review_cycle_artifact``) stays a SEPARATE,
still-hard-error render this WP does not touch -- WP05 owns the demote to
best-effort once its reader flip lands (D-PLAN-11).

This file is deliberately hermetic (no real git repo, no ``review/cycle.py``
call) -- it exercises the append seam directly through ``emit_status_
transition``, mirroring ``tests/status/test_emit.py``'s own fixtures and
seeding helper rather than the heavier, git-backed harness ``tests/
integration/test_review_durability_matrix.py`` (WP05-owned) uses for the
``.md`` artifact's own commit path.

Covers:

* **T012/SC-003** -- two concurrent distinct verdicts (different WPs, same
  mission) must both survive durably, or one must raise an explicit refusal
  -- never a silent drop. Driven through 2 real OS processes because
  ``feature_status_lock`` is an inter-process ``FileLock``; a threaded
  harness would not exercise the real serialization boundary.
* **T013/FR-008** -- the event append alone is sufficient for the reducer
  snapshot to carry the recorded verdict, with a non-vacuity guard proving
  the assertion is not a tautology.
* **T014/NFR-001** -- no ``git``/subprocess call is ever made while the
  durability lock is held (the append discipline is the serialization, not
  a lock spanning ``git``).
* **T014/NFR-004** -- exactly one authoritative durability-append call
  occurs per recorded verdict (the ``.md`` render commit is excluded from
  this count by construction -- this file never calls into ``review/
  cycle.py`` at all).
* **T015/NFR-005** -- a single verdict record, including durable
  persistence, completes well under the 2-second budget.

# 2026-08-08 (WP06, #3256, mission verdict-seam-boundary-hardening-01KZG179):
# WHY this module-level mark is STILL `fast`, not `stress` -- read before
# "fixing" it back to what an earlier plan assumed. This module has SIX
# tests, not one: the T013/T014/T015 classes below are genuinely fast,
# hermetic, sub-second, pure-logic checks that correctly belong in the
# `fast-tests-status` CI job. Only the standalone
# `test_two_concurrent_distinct_verdicts_are_both_durable` (two real forked
# OS processes, internal 30s waits each) does not: it inflates a job whose
# whole purpose is a quick feedback loop (and several other jobs `need:` it,
# so its wall-clock gates them too) with 30-90s of real subprocess spawn/join
# overhead. A module-level mark is all-or-nothing -- pytest markers
# accumulate, they cannot be "cancelled" for one test inside a module that
# sets a blanket mark -- so flipping this line to `stress` would sweep the
# other five tests out of `fast-tests-status` right alongside the one that
# actually needs to move. `fast-tests-status` (see
# `.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml`) already runs its own selector serially
# (no `-n auto`), so the fix is not about worker-contention isolation the way
# `timing-nfr-serial` is for wall-clock-sensitive assertions -- it is about
# not blocking a "fast" job's SLA (and its dependents) on a test that is
# structurally a multi-process stress scenario, not a unit check.
#
# The actual fix lives at the CI-job boundary instead, mirroring the
# established `and not timing` precedent
# (`.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml`, arch-adversarial pole /
# `fast-tests-charter`): `fast-tests-status`'s own selector gained an
# `or stress` arm inside its negation
# (`fast and not windows_ci and not (git_repo or integration or stress)`), so
# the durability test -- which legitimately carries both `fast` (module-wide,
# still accurate for 5/6 tests) and its own individual `@pytest.mark.stress`
# -- is excluded from that job by the selector, not by stripping its `fast`
# tag. It is picked up instead by the dedicated serial `-m stress` CI job
# (`stress-tests-serial`) added alongside this change. `stress` remains the
# individual marker on the one test that needs it (see marker_baseline.txt);
# every fixture in this file stays tmp_path-based (no real git repo; the one
# `subprocess.run` reference is a mocked patch target, not a real invocation)
# -- only the CI-lane routing changed, not the hermetic fixture design.
#
# #3235 coordination pointer: #3235 is a SEPARATE, still-open P0
# (concurrent review-cycle commit data-loss; its own red-first repro lives at
# tests/integration/test_review_durability_matrix.py::
# test_sc004_two_concurrent_processes_never_clobber_a_verdict_over_50_iterations).
# It is in the same "two real concurrent OS processes racing a durability
# write" test family as this module's test, but WP06 does NOT touch #3235's
# repro or fix its bug -- this pointer exists so that if a FUTURE change
# relocates or renames this file (e.g. to tests/stress/), the mover checks
# whether #3235's issue text or any other doc references this file's old
# path/name and updates it, rather than silently stranding the cross-
# reference.
