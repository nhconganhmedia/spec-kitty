"""ATDD: status doctor must flag an uninitialized mission, not report Healthy.

Upstream #1589 (facet 2): when a mission has WP definitions but canonical status
was never bootstrapped (e.g. finalize-tasks aborted on a dependency cycle),
``run_doctor`` skips every WP-level check (``if snapshot:``) and returns zero
findings, so ``is_healthy`` is True. Operators see "Healthy" for a mission whose
runtime is completely wedged.

These tests drive the real ``run_doctor`` and fail on the unfixed code because no
finding is emitted for the uninitialized state.
