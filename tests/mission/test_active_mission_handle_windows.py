"""Native Windows regression test: active-mission handle round-trip without symlink support.

On Windows without Developer Mode, ``os.symlink()`` raises ``OSError`` with
``[WinError 1314]``.  The active-mission selector in
``specify_cli.context.mission_resolver.resolve_mission`` must still resolve a
mission handle reliably when the resolution path never touches symlinks.

This test writes a ``meta.json`` to a temporary ``kitty-specs/<slug>/``
directory and then calls ``resolve_mission(handle, repo_root)`` with several
handle forms:

1. Full ``mission_id`` (26-char ULID)
2. ``mid8`` prefix (first 8 chars)
3. Full slug (directory name)
4. Human slug (directory name without numeric prefix)

Each form must resolve to the same mission.  No symlinks are created, so the
test passes even when Developer Mode is off.

Marked ``@pytest.mark.windows_ci`` — runs only on the ``windows-latest`` CI
job (skipped on POSIX CI runners via the ``-m "not windows_ci"`` filter).

Spec IDs: FR-014, FR-016, FR-017, NFR-001
