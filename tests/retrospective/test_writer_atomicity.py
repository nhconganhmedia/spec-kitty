"""Atomicity tests for the retrospective record writer.

Simulates a mid-write crash by monkeypatching os.replace to raise after the
tempfile has been written.  After the crash the canonical file must be either:
  - absent (first write), or
  - unchanged (second write where a prior version existed).

Sibling tempfiles may exist; that is expected.
