"""WP03 (FR-003) — single home-resolution authority enumerating guard.

The retrospective home (``retrospective.yaml``) must be resolved through ONE
primary-anchored authority (``resolve_retrospective_home`` →
``_compose_primary_feature_dir`` gated by ``is_primary_artifact_kind``; NEVER
the public ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` wrapper — see
read-side-seam-primary-primitive-closure-01KYKMMT WP03 cycle-1 B1, an
NFR-009 read_dir cycle). Today
SIX placement sites used to resolve the home independently — five via the
coord-aware ``resolve_feature_dir_for_*`` resolvers, one via a hardcoded
``.kittify/missions/<id>/retrospective.yaml`` payload string. Any of them landed
the record in the ephemeral coord worktree (or reported a stale path), re-splitting
the brain (#1771).

This module is the anti-rename-vacuous guard: it ENUMERATES the home-resolution
surfaces by AST (no hardcoded count) and asserts that NONE of the placement
modules reintroduces an independent resolution. A 7th site — or reverting site #6
to its hardcoded payload — FAILS the build here, so a future edit cannot quietly
re-open the coord-leak.

Discipline (#2071): the assertion is over the observable AST of the placement
surfaces, derived dynamically — not a frozen list of line numbers.
