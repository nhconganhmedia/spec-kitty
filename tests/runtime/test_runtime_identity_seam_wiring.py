"""Seam-wiring regression guards for the identity trio -- the residual
delegates forward to the seam, and intra-seam calls resolve
``_primary_runtime_feature_dir`` via a LIVE lookup through ``runtime_bridge``
so the pre-existing monkeypatch-based tests in
``tests/runtime/test_runtime_bridge_identity.py`` stay effective.

(Pure-shape checks -- seam-defines-symbol and the native-delegate
``__module__`` assertion -- were intentionally dropped here: they were once
covered family-wide by a dedicated frozen bridge compat-surface guard, retired
in #3285.)
