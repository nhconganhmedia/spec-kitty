"""ATDD unit tests for FR-001: ``_flip_phase`` routed through the placement port.

Red-first proof (contract C-WRITER-1, WP01 T001/T002) for
``migration/runtime_state_cutover.py``'s sole ``status_phase`` writer:

* a resolved PRIMARY home that disagrees with the write target fails closed
  (:class:`~specify_cli.migration.runtime_state_cutover.PlacementMismatchError`,
  writes nothing) — driven through the PRE-EXISTING public entry point
  ``cutover_mission(feature_dir, status_feature_dir=...)``, not the private
  ``_flip_phase`` directly;
* the mismatch fixture independently proves the port resolves WITHOUT raising
  (anti-scaffold: a resolver crash must never masquerade as this fail-close);
* a genuine resolver *raise* on an otherwise well-formed legacy mission (no
  enclosing git repo) degrades instead of aborting — the entire pre-existing
  ``test_runtime_state_cutover.py`` suite already pins this path (every fixture
  there is a bare ``tmp_path`` with no ``.git``), so this file adds one explicit,
  self-documenting instance of it;
* a genuine PRIMARY dir (the resolved-home == write-target case) still flips
  normally — the non-mismatch regression anchor.
