"""WP01 red-first regression: claim-anchor payload determinism across legs.

Runtime-state seed **identity** (``deterministic_ulid = sha256(mission_id |
wp_id | field)``) has always been leg-independent — it carries no wall-clock
or randomness. The seed **payload**, specifically the resolved claim ``at``
anchor, was not: :func:`_synthesize_claim_anchor` fell back to reading
``meta.json.created_at`` from whichever directory happened to be the
*event-write* leg (``feature_dir``) rather than the mission's PRIMARY leg
(``read_dir`` — where ``tasks/`` frontmatter and ``meta.json`` canonically
live). Under coordination topology the two legs are genuinely different
directories, so the two stamp callers (``spec-kitty merge`` and the WP02
accept-time seam) could synthesize two different anchors for the exact same
mission, producing a flipped-but-unverifiable corpus (R5 / NFR-004).

This test seeds the same fixture mission from two distinct COORD write-leg
directories against one shared PRIMARY read leg and asserts the produced
``status.events.jsonl`` bytes are identical -- proving the anchor is pinned
to the PRIMARY leg regardless of what (if anything) the COORD leg's own
``meta.json`` says.
