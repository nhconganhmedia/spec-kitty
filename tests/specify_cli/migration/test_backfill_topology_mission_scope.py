"""Regression: ``migrate backfill-topology --mission X`` blast-radius scope (WP06 / #2219).

#2219 — the repo-global backfill churn (the ~203-file blast radius) — was ALREADY FIXED
upstream (#2070 added the ``--mission <slug>`` scope to ``backfill_topology_repo`` and
the ``migrate backfill-topology`` command; #1814 made ``read_topology`` a pure,
non-persisting reader). This module is the DURABLE GUARD: it drives the real
``migrate backfill-topology --mission X`` CLI surface in a multi-mission repo and proves
ONLY the target ``meta.json`` is mutated while every sibling stays BYTE-IDENTICAL.

Non-vacuousness (C-006 reasoned-RED). The fixture seeds BOTH the target AND ≥ 1 sibling
mission that LACK the ``topology`` field, so the sibling is a genuine backfill candidate
that ONLY the ``--mission`` scoping — not the idempotent-skip
(:func:`backfill_mission_topology` ``action="skip"`` when ``topology`` is already
present) — can keep untouched. :func:`test_unscoped_repo_global_walk_dirties_sibling`
exercises the SAME fixture through the UNSCOPED repo walk (behaviourally the pre-#2070
repo-global path) and asserts it DOES dirty the topology-lacking sibling — proving the
scope guard is load-bearing rather than a tautology. A sibling that already carried
``topology`` would be left alone by the idempotent-skip regardless of scoping, so the
byte-identical assertion would prove nothing.

Verified-already-fixed pin (#2219): ``0e270b10a`` / ``5b8e317aa`` (#2070 / #1814).
No production change — this WP is verify-and-guard only (NFR-002).
