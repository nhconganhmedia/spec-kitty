"""Regression tests for FR-007 (#774): the canonical shape of
``spec-kitty agent decision`` must stay consistent across the CLI surface,
its rendered help, and every documentation/skill/template reference.

The canonical shape is:

    spec-kitty agent decision { open | resolve | defer | cancel | verify }

Three invariants, all already correct on ``main`` (verified during
planning of mission ``release-3-2-0a5-tranche-1``, research note R6):

1. **CLI shape**: introspection of the agent app shows the ``decision``
   subgroup exposes exactly the five canonical *visible* subcommands.
2. **Help shape**: ``spec-kitty agent decision --help`` lists those five.
3. **Docs/skills/templates**: no surviving non-canonical phrasing exists
   anywhere under ``docs/``, ``.agents/skills/``, the rendered skill
   snapshots, or the mission templates.

The non-canonical regex is anchored on the ``spec-kitty`` prefix so that
prose like "decision documentation requirement" or "decisions about ..."
does not produce false positives.

Note on the ``widen`` subcommand: ``decision_app`` registers a sixth
subcommand named ``widen`` with ``hidden=True``. The contract specifies
the *visible* surface, so we filter to non-hidden subcommands when
asserting set equality.
