"""WP04 / FR-006 -- pin the ``charter.md``-only status-collector shape.

``_collect_charter_sync_status`` (``_status_collectors.py``) resolves charter
presence primarily via ``_resolve_charter_bundle_path`` (the authoritative
``charter.yaml`` bundle, FR-005). When that resolution raises
``TaskCliError`` -- i.e. ``charter.yaml`` is absent -- the collector falls
back to the legacy ``charter.md``-only resolver (``_status_collectors.py``
``:85-87``). Per the spec (FR-006, Edge Cases, C-001) this fallback is an
**explicit, documented pre-consolidation migration-compat branch**: it
serves projects created before the ``charter.yaml`` bundle existed
(``charter.md`` present, ``charter.yaml`` absent).

This is a **characterization pin (green-first), NOT an ATDD red**. The
``charter.md``-only shape already resolves correctly today
(``_status_collectors.py:72-87``) -- this test passes on first authoring.
Its purpose is to guard the already-working behaviour so a later "scope or
remove" pass on the ``:85-87`` branch cannot silently change it without a
test noticing.

Whether the ``charter.md``-only shape should be declared *unsupported* (and
the branch flipped to an error path) is a support-scope product decision
that must be routed through the human-in-charge + issue-matrix (DIR-012 /
C-005) -- it is explicitly OUT of scope for this pin, which only asserts
today's supported behaviour.

The staleness **display** header/listing (``:74-84``, ``:103``) is
untouched by this WP (legitimate display, C-001) and is not exercised
differently here than by the existing ``test_status_json_safe.py`` suite.
