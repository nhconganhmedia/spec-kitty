"""Regression: read-surface == write-surface for a coordination mission's
healthy verbatim commit path (PR #2662 adversarial-squad finding).

The implement-claim idempotency guard skips files already identical on the ref
they will be COMMITTED to, so a re-discovered edit does not produce an empty
commit that ``safe_commit`` rejects. On the healthy ``placement_ref is not
None`` path the whole batch commits VERBATIM to ``placement_ref.ref`` (the
coord ref on a coordination mission -- the C-004/#2160 deferral leaves it
un-partitioned). Before the fix the guard compared a PRIMARY artifact against
``HEAD`` while the write went to coord, so a PRIMARY ``spec.md`` already on
coord but differing from ``HEAD`` was re-committed → empty commit → the SECOND
claim hard-failed with ``typer.Exit(1)``.

These tests use the REAL ``BookkeepingTransaction`` (the sibling write-side
suite monkeypatches a fake, which is why the empty-commit was never exercised).
The invariant: the read ref must be the SAME surface as the write target.
