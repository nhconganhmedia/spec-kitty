"""Re-export closeout for the ``doctor`` orchestration shim (WP11, #2059).

The #2059 decomposition moved every subcommand's logic into ``_*_doctor`` /
``_*`` siblings. The public ``doctor`` import surface MUST stay byte-stable so the
58 doctor test files (and any external importer) keep resolving the contracted
symbols ``from specify_cli.cli.commands.doctor import ...`` — this test pins that
contract (FR-006, I-5).

# which asserts frozenset-equality (a stronger, name-aware contract that implies
# the count); the pointer-comment test asserted a source string with no
# behavioural contract.
