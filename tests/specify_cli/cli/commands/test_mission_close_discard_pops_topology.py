"""Permanent guard: ``mission close --discard`` must pop ``topology``, not
just ``coordination_branch`` (#3219 / FR-015 / SC-009) -- the discard-pops-
topology bug is fixed.

Formerly a red-first ``@pytest.mark.regression`` reproduction under
``tests/regression/``; relocated here (next to
``test_mission_type_force_delete_branch.py``, its functional home -- both
are direct, no-git unit tests of ``specify_cli.cli.commands.mission_type``
helpers) and un-marked (2026-08 landing fold: make
``@pytest.mark.regression`` mean exactly one thing) once
``_flatten_discarded_mission`` converged onto the canonical
``flatten_coordination_metadata`` primitive and this suite went stably
green. Note: #3219 itself remained OPEN at relocation time for the broader
primitive-extraction refactor it also tracks -- only this specific
discard-pops-topology defect is confirmed fixed here.

Before verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35 WP10, ``_flatten_discarded_mission``
called only ``clear_coordination_metadata`` -- ONE of the canonical THREE
coordination-flatten mutations. It cleared ``coordination_branch`` but never
popped the stored ``topology`` and never recorded ``flattened=True``. A discarded
coordination mission therefore kept a stale ``topology: "coord"`` value in
``meta.json``, so a later command could still resolve it as a coordination
Mission and hit ``CoordinationBranchDeleted`` (the #1848 data-loss hard-fail) --
on a mission the operator had already discarded.

``_flatten_discarded_mission`` now converges onto the canonical
``flatten_coordination_metadata`` primitive (T051), which performs all three
mutations (clear ``coordination_branch``, pop ``topology``, record
``flattened=True``) atomically.
