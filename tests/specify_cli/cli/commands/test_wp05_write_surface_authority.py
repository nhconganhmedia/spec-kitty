"""WP05 — single write-surface authority for planning commits (FR-007, #2063, SC-004).

Covers:

* **T025** — ``safe_commit_cmd`` separates its two responsibilities (NFR-002): the
  generic operator-file path keeps ``--to-branch``/HEAD inference; the
  mission-aware planning path (a ``kitty-specs/<slug>/`` artifact for a resolvable
  mission) resolves its destination via the WP03 seam, never from
  ``get_current_branch``.
* **T026 (re-pinned, WP02 FR-003 / C-005)** — under the converged write path a
  coord-topology **planning** commit (``spec.md``, a ``SPEC`` kind) lands on the
  **primary** ``target_branch`` (NOT the coordination worktree), and the committed
  ``spec.md`` is **read back** from the same **primary** surface via the
  next-command read leg (the #2063 round-trip, now coherent on the *primary*
  seam per WP03 T012's "preserved and corrected" note). The paired coord-side
  assertion proves the **bifurcation** still holds: a ``STATUS_STATE`` (C-001
  coordination-partition) commit on the SAME mission still routes to the
  coordination branch — so the test fails red if planning ever regressed back to
  coord, *or* if status ever leaked onto primary.

These tests exercise the REAL kind-aware seam (``resolve_placement_only`` /
``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission``) on a real protected-primary repo — a test
that only mocks the router or asserts the WRITE leg is insufficient (renata /
SC-004).

WP02 history (delete-the-assertion-not-the-test): this class previously asserted
the *removed* planning→coord contract (``placement_ref == _COORD_BRANCH``, read
back from ``.worktrees/<slug>-coord/``). FR-003 removes that path and C-005
forbids preserving it as a fallback (FR-002: "the coordination worktree is never
the authoring/read surface for planning artifacts"). The round-trip structure and
the anti-fakeable negative proof are KEPT and re-targeted onto the primary seam,
not deleted.
