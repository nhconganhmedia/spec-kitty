"""WP00 / FR-009(e) / site #14: the finalize-tasks COMMIT resolves target_branch.

The live dogfood repro (``research/dogfood-finalize-tasks-repro.md``):
``finalize-tasks`` REFUSED to commit its planning artifacts —

    Refusing to commit planning artifacts to the protected branch 'main'.

— because its commit path resolved the planning-commit surface to the protected repo
primary ``main`` instead of the mission's ``target_branch`` (``feat/...``). The
``finalize_tasks`` body commits the TASKS_INDEX artifact through the canonical
``commit_for_mission`` entry point (``mission.py`` ~line 3927, ``kind=TASKS_INDEX``).
``commit_for_mission`` resolves the placement via ``resolve_placement_only`` /
``_resolve_mission_target_branch``, BOTH of which read ``get_feature_target_branch``
internally. Under coord topology that resolver anchored on the coord candidate (no
``meta.json``) and fell back to ``main`` → the placement landed on protected ``main``
→ the #2106 FR-008 guard correctly refused. The resolution to ``main`` is the bug.

This drives the REAL commit machinery the finalize-tasks body uses (``commit_for_mission``
with the SAME ``kind=TASKS_INDEX``), NOT a private resolver. On the unfixed
``get_feature_target_branch`` it is RED (the commit is refused with the protected-``main``
diagnostic / the placement resolves ``main``); after re-pointing the resolver onto the
PRIMARY surface it is GREEN (the TASKS_INDEX placement / commit lands on ``target_branch``).
The #2106 protected-primary guard is preserved — the fix is the resolution, not the guard.

Uses git (a real coordination worktree is needed to reproduce the bug).
