"""FR-008/#1832 (C-IC05): ``agent action implement`` single resolution path.

These tests pin the single-resolution invariant for the implement create/verify
seam: the workspace is resolved exactly once by the caller, and the post-create
verification *consumes* that already-resolved context instead of re-running a
second resolution authority that could report "no workspace could be resolved"
on a verified read-path.

The behavior under test lives in
``workflow._ensure_workspace_materialized`` — the seam extracted from the
implement command's create block (C14). Topology-true fixtures use a full
26-char ULID ``mission_id`` in the slug, a real ``.worktrees/`` lane path with a
``.git`` marker, and a real ``lanes.json``.
