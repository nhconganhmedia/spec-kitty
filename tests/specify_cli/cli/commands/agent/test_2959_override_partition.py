"""#2959 (WP01 / FR-001): the review-artifact override WRITE must land on the
SAME partition the merge review-artifact gate READS.

On a coord-topology mission the merge gate resolves each WP's lane state from
its COORD ``STATUS_STATE`` home (``post_merge/review_artifact_consistency.py``
→ ``resolve_artifact_surface``). Before this WP,
``_persist_review_artifact_override`` derived the emit's ``feature_dir`` from
the PRIMARY-derived artifact path (``artifact_path.parents[2]``), so the
override was appended to the PRIMARY event log — a surface the gate never reads
under a materialised coord topology. The gate therefore kept seeing the stale
rejection and refused the merge: the #2959 deadlock, with no override escape
hatch.

This is the red-first, live-coord-topology proof (NFR-001): the coord worktree
is genuinely materialised by the shared ``coord_topology_mission`` fixture (real
git, no resolver patched), so the write partition and the gate's read partition
are DIFFERENT dirs. The test is RED before the reroute (override on primary,
gate reads coord → not visible) and GREEN after (override on coord → visible on
the gate's read surface).
