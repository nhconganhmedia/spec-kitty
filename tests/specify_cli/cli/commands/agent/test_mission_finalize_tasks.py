"""Tests for WP07 / FR-012 / SC-04: finalize-tasks canonical target branch.

The legacy ``_resolve_planning_branch()`` returned the current checkout
branch. When operators ran ``finalize-tasks`` from a ``prep/...`` branch
(a documented workaround for the legacy main-pin guard), the prep
branch name leaked into every WP's ``merge_target_branch`` frontmatter
and into ``lanes.json``. Once the prep branch was deleted, downstream
lane allocation crashed because the parent ref was gone (issue #1348).

These tests verify the WP07 fix: ``_resolve_planning_branch()`` reads
the canonical target from ``meta.json`` and refuses to inspect the
current checkout. The ``--target-branch`` override exists as an escape
hatch for legacy missions and for explicit operator overrides.

We focus on the resolver itself rather than driving the full
``finalize-tasks`` Typer command — the full command has a heavy
dependency surface (SaaS preflight, ownership inference, scaffold
generation) and the canonical-target behavior is fully expressed by
the resolver path. The integration test in
``tests/integration/test_mission_close.py`` exercises the full pipeline.
