"""Permanent guard for #2508 (coord-authority-trio-degod-01KX7094, WP02/T006).

**Landing note (2026-08, `tests/regression/` campsite clean).** #2508 is
fixed; this is a permanent regression guard, not a red-first reproduction, so
it carries no `regression` marker and lives with its sibling workflow/commit
tests here rather than in `tests/regression/`. The issue number and the
original ownership rationale are kept as history below.

``_load_coord_branch_meta`` (``workflow.py:276``) reads ``meta.json`` off
whatever ``feature_dir`` its caller passes it. ``_commit_workflow_change``
(``workflow.py:571``) passes it the SEAM-resolved, topology-aware
``feature_dir`` -- which for a coord-topology mission is the COORD
WORKTREE, not the primary checkout (``_canonical_status_feature_dir`` ->
``resolve_handle_to_read_path``, a STATUS-partition read). ``meta.json`` is
``PRIMARY_METADATA`` -- a PRIMARY-partition kind (see
``worktree_allocator._read_coordination_branch`` and the dozen other
``MissionArtifactKind.PRIMARY_METADATA`` call sites in the codebase) -- so
when the coord worktree's checked-out copy of ``meta.json`` is stale,
missing, or was materialized before ``coordination_branch`` was known
locally, ``_load_coord_branch_meta`` silently returns ``(None, None,
None)`` and ``_commit_workflow_change`` takes the LEGACY ``safe_commit``
fallback -- even though the mission genuinely has a coordination branch.

This is a concrete instance of the #2160 artifact-authority split-brain
class: an identity read anchored on the wrong partition.

**Observed misfire** (confirmed empirically against pre-fix code before
writing this assertion): the legacy fallback calls ``_commit_via_legacy_
safe_commit(..., worktree_root=repo_root)`` — i.e. it tries to run
``safe_commit`` from the PRIMARY checkout's working tree, whose ``HEAD`` is
the mission's ``target_branch``, NOT the coordination branch the resolved
``CommitTarget`` demands. ``safe_commit`` refuses ("worktree HEAD is
'<target_branch>', expected '<coord_branch>'"), the claim commit is
refused, and the WP01 claim silently rolls back its status-event log
while reporting a "[refused]" commit receipt to the operator -- through
the REAL ``agent action implement`` command entry point, not a synthetic
unit call into ``_commit_workflow_change``.

Ownership note (DIRECTIVE_024 leeway, no-overlap guard, historical): WP02's
``owned_files`` lists ``tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/
test_workflow_cores.py`` for pure-core unit tests. This was originally
authored as a full CLI-entry-point regression repro (git subprocess +
CliRunner over the real Typer app), landed alongside the project's other
numbered-issue regression repros (``tests/regression/test_issue_1348.py``,
itself since relocated to this same directory). No other WP in this mission
owned ``tests/regression/`` (confirmed via the mission's
``tasks/WP0{1,3,4,5}-*.md`` ownership maps) -- there was no overlap.

Marker: integration + git_repo (CliRunner over a real git repository, one
real ``git worktree add`` for the coordination worktree).
