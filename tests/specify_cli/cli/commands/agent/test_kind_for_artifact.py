"""Unit tests for ``_kind_for_artifact`` (write-surface-coherence WP02 / T007).

``_commit_to_branch`` maps its ``artifact_type`` string to a canonical
:class:`~mission_runtime.MissionArtifactKind` via ``_kind_for_artifact``. Every
mapped type is a PRIMARY planning kind (planning artifacts live with their
mission on the primary surface), and an UNMAPPED type raises loudly rather than
silently defaulting to ``SPEC`` (DECISION 1: the kind must be named, not guessed).
