"""WP04 / FR-004 (#2107): ``map-requirements`` must read WP ``tasks/*.md`` off PRIMARY.

The squad-found missed read site (research.md Decision 3): ``map_requirements``
resolved the WP ``tasks/*.md`` glob off the topology-routed ``feature_dir``
(``_map_requirements_feature_dir`` → coord). On a coord-topology mission the
materialised ``-coord`` husk holds an EMPTY ``tasks/`` while the real WP prompt
files live on PRIMARY (WORK_PACKAGE_TASK is a PRIMARY-partition kind). The command
then reported the operator's WP as unknown ("Unknown WP IDs") because it globbed an
empty coord ``tasks/``.

This is a **behavioral** red-first test driven through the REAL ``map-requirements``
CLI entry point with a composed ``<slug>-<mid8>`` fixture (NFR-002):

* PRE-FIX (``tasks_dir = feature_dir / "tasks"`` → coord): the WP is not found in
  the empty coord ``tasks/`` → exit 1, "Unknown WP IDs" — the RED.
* POST-FIX (``tasks_dir`` resolved via the kind-aware seam with
  ``kind=WORK_PACKAGE_TASK`` → primary): the WP file is found and the mapping is
  recorded → exit 0 — the GREEN.

Red-first evidence (run against pre-WP04 ``tasks.py``): the test fails with the
"Unknown WP IDs" error because the pre-fix glob ignores the seam-resolved primary
``tasks/`` and reads the empty coord ``tasks/``.
