"""Permanent guard/acceptance coverage for upstream issue #1589 (facet 1).

**Landing note (2026-08, `tests/regression/` campsite clean).** #1589 is
fixed; this is a permanent regression guard, not a red-first reproduction, so
it carries no `regression` marker and lives with its sibling tasks-CLI tests
here rather than in `tests/regression/`. The issue number is kept as history.

Replicates the real failure: a circular WP dependency aborts ``finalize-tasks``
before canonical status is bootstrapped, so the documented loop command
``move-task`` raises "no canonical status, run finalize-tasks" — a hint that
loops forever because finalize keeps aborting on the same cycle.

This is an end-to-end acceptance test that drives the actual ``move-task`` CLI
against a cyclic, status-uninitialized mission and asserts the operator-visible
output names the dependency cycle as the root cause. It fails on the unfixed
production message (generic "run finalize-tasks") and passes after the fix.
