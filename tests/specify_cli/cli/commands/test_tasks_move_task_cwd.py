"""#2647 — ``move-task`` cwd-independent status surface (WP06, T027-T031).

Reproduces the reported bug: ``agent tasks move-task WP## --to <lane>`` fails
with an "Illegal transition" error when run from a **real lane-worktree cwd**,
even though ``status.events.jsonl`` on the mission's primary checkout
correctly shows the WP already sitting in the FROM lane the transition
expects.

The repro is deliberately real, not mocked: a genuine ``git worktree add``
(so ``is_worktree_context(cwd)`` is tripped by the actual gitdir-pointer
topology, not a fabricated ``.git`` marker) plus a real
``monkeypatch.chdir(worktree)`` before driving the live Typer entry point
(``specify_cli.cli.commands.agent.tasks.app``, ``move-task`` command). No
``tests.mocked_env.setup_mocked_env`` — that helper patches
``locate_project_root`` to unconditionally return the fixture root, which
would erase the exact cwd-dependence this test exists to exercise.

Investigation finding (T027), REVISED after a live reproduction on this
mission's own WP06 lane worktree (see ``../traces/design-decisions.md`` for
the full account) -- the picture is more layered than the WP06 prompt's two
named suspects:

* ``_read_transactional_wp_lane`` (``tasks_move_task.py:308-312``) reads with
  ``repo_root=st.main_repo_root`` -- confirmed NOT the taint.
* ``locate_work_package`` (``task_utils/support.py:309``) internally calls
  ``get_main_repo_root(repo_root)`` again before resolving the WP file --
  confirmed NOT the taint.
* ``resolve_action_context`` (``mission_runtime/resolution.py``) derives every
  fragment from the canonicalized ``primary_root`` -- confirmed CWD-invariant.

Those three reads govern the DECISION half of ``move-task`` (is
``in_progress -> for_review`` a legal edge). The classes below (T028/T030)
pin that this half is genuinely cwd-independent -- GREEN today, and they stay
GREEN.

But ``move-task``'s WRITE half independently RE-DERIVES ``from_lane`` at
commit time, and THAT read is cwd-dependent:
``emit_status_transition_transactional`` ->
``BookkeepingTransaction.acquire`` -> ``_acquire_locked`` (all in
``src/specify_cli/coordination/transaction.py``) classifies any mission
whose ``meta.json`` lacks a ``coordination_branch`` key as "legacy"
(``_is_legacy_mission``, transaction.py:200) -- which is the case for every
modern coordination-less ``single_branch``/``lanes`` mission, not only
genuinely pre-SSOT ones -- and then resolves the write target via
``_resolve_legacy_lane_destination`` (transaction.py:279-330), whose FIRST
line is ``cwd = Path.cwd().resolve()``. That function walks up from the
literal process cwd to find the nearest ``.git`` marker and reads THAT
worktree's own on-disk ``kitty-specs/<slug>/status.events.jsonl`` -- which,
for a lane worktree that was created before later status transitions landed
on the primary/coordination branch, is a genuinely STALE local git-tracked
snapshot. ``BookkeepingTransaction.commit()``'s ``CommitTarget(ref=self.
destination_ref)`` construction at this exact site is ALREADY a tracked,
DEFERRED architectural-debt allow-list entry in
``tests/architectural/test_no_write_side_rederivation.py``
(``_CHECKOUT_GRAMMAR_ALLOW_LIST_SEED``, rationale: "tracked: #2453"), so this
is known, acknowledged debt -- just not previously connected to #2647's
user-visible symptom.

``test_write_side_from_lane_rederivation_no_longer_reproduces_2647`` below was
originally the red-first proof of that write-side taint (``xfail(strict=True)``
against a REAL lane worktree forked BEFORE later status events land on the
primary checkout). The operator expanded WP06's scope to fix #2453 in the same
cycle: ``coordination/transaction.py::_acquire_locked`` now distinguishes
genuinely-legacy missions (no stored topology -- keeps the cwd-derived
routing, there is no other reliable target) from modern coordination-less
missions (stored ``single_branch``/``lanes`` topology, or ``flattened`` --
reusing ``_warrants_legacy_warning``'s classification, C-005) and routes the
latter to ``repo_root`` on the caller-resolved ``target_branch`` instead of
``Path.cwd()``. The test below is now an unmarked GREEN assertion; see
``tests/specify_cli/coordination/test_transaction_legacy_topology_routing.py``
for the characterization-first unit-level coverage of the three routing
shapes.

    Was ``xfail(strict=True)`` -- the WP06 cycle-1 characterization pinned
    this as a genuine RED reproduction of #2647 via
    ``coordination/transaction.py``'s write-side ``from_lane`` re-derivation
    (``_is_legacy_mission`` misclassified every modern coordination-less
    ``single_branch``/``lanes`` mission as "legacy" and routed the commit
    through ``_resolve_legacy_lane_destination``'s ``Path.cwd()`` read). The
    #2453 fix (``_acquire_locked``, reusing ``_warrants_legacy_warning``'s
    stored-topology classification) routes a modern coordination-less
    mission's status commit to ``repo_root`` on the caller-resolved
    ``target_branch`` instead -- cwd-independent. FR-001 is now genuinely
    satisfied: this is a real, unmarked GREEN assertion, not an expected
    failure.

    Unlike the flat/no-meta.json fixture used by the tests above (which never
    exercises ``BookkeepingTransaction``'s "legacy" branch at all, since
    ``_transaction_topology_available`` short-circuits to the non-
    transactional path when no meta.json/coord branch exists), this fixture
    matches production shape: a real ``meta.json`` with a ``mission_id`` and
    ``single_branch`` topology, no ``coordination_branch``.
