"""A structurally invalid ``config.yaml`` must not crash identity (#3030 FR-022 follow-up).

``load_identity`` did ``config.get("project", {})`` on whatever YAML returned. YAML
documents are not all mappings, so every non-mapping top level raised
``AttributeError`` out of a function whose docstring promises it "handles malformed
config gracefully". Found while fencing ``sync/routing.py`` off from it: a list-shaped
config crashed the sync policy gate instead of answering a boolean.

Probed before fixing, and it was not one shape but four — any non-mapping node:

===================  ==========================================  ============================
top-level YAML       ``load_identity`` before                    write path before
===================  ==========================================  ============================
``- a\\n- list``      ``AttributeError`` (``CommentedSeq``)        ``AttributeError``
``hello``            ``AttributeError`` (``str``)                 ``AttributeError``
``42``               ``AttributeError`` (``int``)                 ``AttributeError``
``"a string"``       ``AttributeError`` (``str``)                 ``AttributeError``
empty file           already handled (``or {}``)                  rewritten (mints)
comments only        already handled (``or {}``)                  rewritten (mints)
unparseable YAML     already handled (``except``)                 ``ParserError`` escapes
``project: scalar``  already handled (``isinstance``)             rewritten (mints)
===================  ==========================================  ============================

Two properties follow, and they are the same rule in the two directions:

* **Reading** a file that cannot be understood yields *no identity*, never an
  exception — the answer ``load_identity`` already gave for a parse error, and the
  same notion ``sync/consent.py`` encodes as ``ConfigReadFault(kind="unparseable",
  detail="top-level content is not a mapping")``. One notion, not two.
* **Writing** over a file that could not be understood is refused. An identity
  regenerated onto an unreadable file would replace the operator's ``sync.enabled:
  false``, their comments and every other section with an identity-only document —
  destroying exactly what could not be read.
