"""An unusable recorded identity *value* must not crash the policy read (#3030 FR-024).

FR-023 fenced the top-level *shape* of ``.kittify/config.yaml``. A perfectly valid
mapping whose ``project.uuid`` cannot be parsed sailed straight past that fence,
because ``ProjectIdentity.from_dict`` called ``UUID(uuid_str)`` **outside**
``load_identity``'s ``try/except`` — which wrapped only the YAML parse. A merge
conflict marker in a tracked, hand-edited file is a realistic route to it.

Probed as a *set* (not the three shapes that were reported), across every field
``from_dict`` reads, through read, write and both routing entry points, with a
valid-config positive control that must pass. Measured **before** the fix:

============  ====================================================  ==========================
``project.``  before                                                after
============  ====================================================  ==========================
``uuid``      11 of 13 shapes RAISED out of ``load_identity``,       no identity, no raise
              ``resolve_identity``, ``ensure_identity`` and BOTH     (or the value, where it
              routing entry points, in three flavours:               is understandable:
              ``ValueError`` (``not-a-uuid``, ``<<<<<<< HEAD``,      a padded uuid is
              a padded uuid, whitespace-only), ``AttributeError``    accepted, whitespace-
              (``42``, ``1.5``, ``true``, mapping, sequence, an      only is absence)
              all-digit int), ``TypeError`` (``2026-07-30``).
              ``""``/``~`` were already absence.
``repo_slug`` ``load_identity`` did NOT raise — it handed a         no identity (container)
              non-``str`` onward, and **both routing entry points**  or text (scalar); the
              then died in someone else's code: ``TypeError:         gate answers
              argument of type 'int' is not iterable`` and
              ``TypeError: unhashable type: 'CommentedMap'``.
              7 of 13 shapes. **Not previously reported.**
``slug``,     no crash on any probed path, but a ``dict`` /          None-or-``str``,
``node_id``,  ``list`` / ``date`` / ``int`` was stored in a field    always
``build_id``  annotated ``str | None`` and written back to disk
============  ====================================================  ==========================

The fix is at the parse — one site for ``load_identity``'s seven production callers —
and it gives the FR-022/FR-023 answer rather than a fourth one: **reading** a record
that cannot be understood yields no identity and never raises, **writing** over it is
refused with ``ConfigNotUnderstoodError``, which ``ensure_identity`` degrades.

Two decisions this file pins, both deliberate:

* A uuid is **accepted after stripping** (and after YAML's implicit typing is undone),
  not treated as a fault. ``sync/consent.py`` already reads the same key as
  ``str(raw).strip() or None``; making identity call it a fault would leave the two
  modules disagreeing about which uuid a config declares — the two-notions-one-
  function-apart pathology (C-003). Whitespace-only and ``""`` stay *absence* for the
  same reason, and the parse still keeps ``''``/whitespace unpersistable (FR-017).
* YAML's implicit typing is undone rather than rejected: ``node_id: 123456789012``
  and a dash-less 32-hex ``uuid`` are legitimate values that YAML resolves to ``int``.
  Containers are a genuine fault — no text was recorded there, and ``str()`` of a
  ``CommentedMap`` would ship a Python repr upstream as the project's identity.
