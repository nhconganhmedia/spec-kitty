"""Public lock-root behavioral invariant (T006, paula S-4 / S-9).

The existing lock-root tests (``test_emit_lock_root_*`` / ``test_lifecycle_lock_root_*``)
assert the **private helper by name** (``_feature_status_lock_root`` /
``_repo_root_for_lock``). FR-001 deletes those helpers (routes them to
``workspace.primary_root``), so by-name tests break on deletion and form-couple
the suite to a symbol the adoption removes.

This module adds the PUBLIC behavioral invariant the private tests were really
guarding, so WP02 can retire the by-name coverage without losing it:

    Two processes anchored on ONE mission — one via the primary checkout CWD,
    one via the coordination-worktree CWD — must acquire the SAME status lock
    (mutual exclusion). Concretely, the lock PATH (``feature_status_lock_path``
    over the resolved lock root) is byte-identical no matter which worktree the
    process anchored from.

It is expressed through the **public** lock surface
(``feature_status_lock_path``) and the canonical resolver the adoption routes
to — never by naming the private helper — so it is invariant across the swap.
