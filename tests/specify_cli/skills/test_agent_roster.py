"""Single-source authority tests for the skill-only agent roster (#1941).

The skill-only roster (``codex``, ``vibe``, ``pi``, ``letta``) used to be
duplicated as three byte-identical literals. WP03 collapsed them onto the leaf
module :mod:`specify_cli.skills._agent_roster`. These tests prove the collapse
is a *derivation*, not a coincidental equal literal:

* an identity/equality check that the installer and renderer rosters resolve to
  the leaf authority, and
* a monkeypatch-derivation test that patches the leaf and reloads the dependent
  modules, asserting the change propagates to
  ``config.SKILL_ONLY_AGENTS``/``VALID_AGENTS`` and
  ``command_renderer.SUPPORTED_AGENTS``. A coincidental equal literal would NOT
  reflect the patched value and would fail this test.

    This is the anti-coincidence guard for ``config.py``: if it still carried

    the patched roster and this test would fail. (Installer and renderer share
    the *same object* as the leaf — proved by the ``is``-identity tests above,
    which a coincidental equal literal can never satisfy. ``config`` derives a
    new ``set`` each import, so it needs the reload to re-evaluate.)

    Only ``config`` is reloaded: reloading ``command_renderer`` /
    ``command_installer`` would rebind their exception/dataclass *types*, which
    other already-imported modules catch via ``except``/``isinstance`` — an
    identity hazard unrelated to the roster. The leaf-identity tests cover them.
