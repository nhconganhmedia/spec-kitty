"""WP00 / FR-004 / FR-009(e): write-surface resolvers anchor on the PRIMARY meta.

Under coordination topology the topology-aware ``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission``
resolves to the coordination worktree, whose mission dir holds only
``status.events.jsonl`` / ``status.json`` — **no ``meta.json``**. The two write-branch
resolvers (:func:`get_feature_target_branch` in ``core.paths`` and
:func:`resolve_target_branch` in ``core.git_ops``) read ``meta.json`` to resolve a
mission's commit/branch surface; anchoring that read on the coord candidate found
nothing and silently fell back to the protected repo primary ``main`` — the exact
class that refused ``finalize-tasks`` / blocked the implement loop (see
``research/dogfood-finalize-tasks-repro.md`` / ``research/debbie-posttasks.md``).

The fix re-points both onto ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` — the already-proven
shape of :func:`resolve_merge_target_branch` (``core/paths.py:630-675``). This is the
WRITE twin of the read-side consolidation (G-6). The status/coord destinations are
UNCHANGED (this only fixes the planning commit/branch resolution).

Red-first (NFR-002 / DIRECTIVE_034): the fixture is the coord-topology shape debbie
reproduced — a composed ``<slug>-<mid8>`` primary dir with a real ``meta.json``
(``target_branch=feat/...``) plus a materialized coordination worktree whose mission
dir has NO ``meta.json``. On the unfixed resolver these assertions are RED (resolve
``main``); after the re-point they are GREEN (resolve ``target_branch``). Reverting the
resolver to ``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`` turns them RED again.

Uses git (a real coordination worktree is needed to reproduce the bug).
