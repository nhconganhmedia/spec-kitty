"""WP05 (coord-write-placement-closure-01KYCF83) / T020-T023 — stale-sweep
claim-liveness off the reduced snapshot, driven through the real
``spec-kitty agent action implement`` claim entry point (DIRECTIVE_041), plus
the frontmatter write-retirement + reader-scope proof this WP's Definition of
Done requires.

**Landing note (2026-08, `tests/regression/` campsite clean).** This is a
permanent guard, not a red-first reproduction, so it carries no `regression`
marker and lives with its direct sibling
``tests/specify_cli/core/test_stale_detection_snapshot_liveness.py`` here
rather than in `tests/regression/`. It partially overlaps that sibling (both
cover live/dead snapshot-PID staleness flips) but adds a real angle the
sibling does not: this file seeds the claim through the real
``implement`` CLI entry point (verified during this relocation — the
sibling's ``_claim`` helper writes the event directly, never invoking a CLI
command), so it also exercises the frontmatter write-retirement and
liveness-reader-scope invariants the CLI path can uniquely disturb.

**Scope note (live-evidence finding, recorded per DIRECTIVE_041/failing-test
discipline — this is NOT a fabricated red).** WP05 was planned against IC-07's
description of the codebase where ``stale_detection.py``'s
``_is_claiming_process_alive`` still read ``shell_pid`` directly out of WP
frontmatter, ``task_metadata_validation.py`` carried a comparable frontmatter
reader, and ``frontmatter.py`` was the live authoring seam for the claim
``shell_pid``/``agent`` dual-write. By the time this WP actually executed, the
entire reader-migration-before-retire sequence had already landed via prior,
already-merged work predating this mission (the FR-005/#2684 and #2816
"runtime-state corpus cutover" missions, commits ``04953ea44``/``7c1a10163``
and ``452f296fa``/``dfe6b2ead``/``65a2bb780`` — verified via
``git log main..HEAD -- <file>`` returning empty for all three of this WP's
owned production files, i.e. zero commits on this mission's base for any of
them):

* ``core/stale_detection.py``'s ``check_wp_staleness`` already resolves
  ``shell_pid``/``shell_pid_created_at`` unconditionally from the reduced
  snapshot whenever a ``feature_dir`` is supplied
  (``_resolve_claim_liveness_inputs`` -> ``_read_wp_runtime_snapshot_state``),
  never blending in the frontmatter-extracted arguments (C-001). This is
  exhaustively covered already by
  ``tests/specify_cli/core/test_stale_detection_snapshot_liveness.py``
  (a prior mission's own WP05, T018/T021) — this file adds the CLI-entry-point
  angle that file does not cover (a real ``implement`` claim, not a direct
  ``emit_status_transition`` call).
* ``task_metadata_validation.py`` never had a liveness reader to migrate: its
  only ``shell_pid`` reference is ``repair_lane_mismatch``'s parameter, which
  is folded into a free-text Activity-Log audit note (MIGRATION-ONLY legacy
  lane repair) and is never read back as a claim-liveness signal by
  ``detect_lane_mismatch``/``validate_task_metadata``/``scan_all_tasks_for_mismatches``.
  There is no reader in this file for T022 to migrate.
* the claim ``shell_pid``/``agent`` frontmatter write is already retired
  unconditionally — ``workflow_executor.py::_implement_write_claim_and_commit``
  documents "the WP file is NOT mutated for the claim... this function writes
  0 runtime bytes to the WP file", confirmed by the pre-existing
  ``tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/test_implement_runtime_frontmatter_claim.py``
  and by WP04's own
  ``tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_claim_event_source.py`` (this
  mission, already merged; relocated out of ``tests/regression/`` in the
  2026-08 landing fold). ``frontmatter.py`` itself never contained the
  write function (the god-write lived in ``tasks_move_task.py``'s deleted
  ``_mt_dual_write_wp_file``) — it only carries the ``shell_pid``/
  ``SHELL_PID_BASELINE_FIELD`` field-order position and the
  ``WP_RUNTIME_FIELDS`` legacy-classification set (both retained
  intentionally, out of this WP's scope to remove: ``WP_RUNTIME_FIELDS`` is
  exercised by ``implement_cores.py``'s dirty-tree-only-runtime-diff guard,
  owned by a different WP, and still legitimately classifies
  ``base_branch``/``base_commit``/``planning_base_branch`` which genuinely
  ARE still written at workspace-creation time).

This file therefore cannot be red-first for a reader migration or a write
deletion (there is neither a live frontmatter read nor a live frontmatter
write left to change): it LOCKS IN the current, already-correct behavior as
WP05's own owned regression coverage (create_intent), proven through the real
CLI claim entry point rather than the lower-level ``emit_status_transition``
call the prior mission's coverage used.
