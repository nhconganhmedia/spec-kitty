"""Regression lock for #2088 — closeout of epic #1716 (WP17).

#2088 fixed `validate_no_overlap` (src/specify_cli/ownership/validation.py) so it
no longer rejects two WPs that share `owned_files` when a dependency edge makes
them strictly sequential (same-lane, never concurrent). Before the fix, ANY two
WPs sharing owned_files were flagged, which made linearized refactor chains
(including this very mission's own 17-WP same-lane decomposition, e.g. WP17
depending on WP03/WP11/WP16) impossible to express without spurious overlap
errors.

This is a thin, standalone lock — deliberately independent of
`tests/specify_cli/ownership/test_validation.py` — so that a change which
accidentally deletes or narrows the dependency-aware exemption in that suite
does not silently drop coverage for the underwriting invariant #1716 relies on.

See: kitty-specs/read-surface-ssot-closeout-01KWZV91/tasks/WP17-closeout-1716-2088-2100.md (T048)
