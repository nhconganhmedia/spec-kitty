"""Hash-unification pin across the real freshness surfaces (WP04 / FR-008b,
C2-d; re-pointed at ``charter.yaml`` by consolidate-charter-bundle WP06 /
Landmine 2).

C2-d already landed: ``sync`` and ``charter status`` still route
``charter.md`` content hashing through the one ``charter.hasher.hash_content``
path (unchanged by this mission — ``charter.md`` is a curated, never-resolving
companion, not touched by this WP). This pin guards against those two
surfaces *stopping* routing through it (e.g. a reintroduced local
``hashlib.sha256``).

Landmine 2 retires the freshness computer's own ``charter.md``-hash producer
(``_charter_hash_of``) outright — there is no longer a THIRD hashed-surface
for this pin to compare against on ``charter.md``. Instead, this file also
pins the freshness computer's ``charter_source`` sub-state against a real
``charter.yaml`` — proving it reads the file the mission relocated freshness
onto, independently of the (unrelated, still-live) ``charter.md``/sync
hash-unification pin.

Anti-tautology (F1): the test invokes the ACTUAL surface functions — the
``charter status`` collector (``_collect_charter_sync_status`` → ``is_stale``)
and the ``sync`` staleness primitive (``is_stale`` as ``sync`` calls it on
content) — and asserts they agree on the SAME content. It does NOT call
``hash_content`` N times (that would be ``assert x == x``). The
mutate-and-diverge negative guard proves both surfaces read the same content
through the same normalization.
