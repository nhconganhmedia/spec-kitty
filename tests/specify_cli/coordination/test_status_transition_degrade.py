"""Red-first coverage for the WP05 pre-gate adoption (FR-005, IC-06b, C-004).

``status_transition._resolve_write_target`` now routes through the shared
``resolve_write_target_or_degrade`` helper (WP04, ``mission_runtime``), which
ADDS a ``_mission_meta_exists`` pre-gate the hand-rolled selector never had.

**The real behavior change this pins**: before this WP, the ``try`` arm
unconditionally called ``resolve_placement_only`` -- which, per its own
documented contract, *never raises* for a merely-absent mission; it silently
degrades **internally** to ``get_feature_target_branch(repo_root,
mission_slug)`` (the repo's generic target/primary branch), with **no
awareness of the caller's ``coord_branch`` argument at all** (that value only
ever fed the ``except`` arm, which this silent-internal-degrade contract made
unreachable in the merely-absent-mission window). So a caller supplying a real
``coord_branch`` in the bootstrap window got it silently DISCARDED -- the
write landed on the repo's primary branch instead.

The new pre-gate closes this: when ``meta.json`` is absent, resolution is
skipped entirely and ``degrade_ref = coord_branch or
get_feature_target_branch(...)`` is returned directly -- honoring a supplied
``coord_branch`` instead of silently dropping it.

See: spec.md FR-005 / C-004; contracts/degrade-and-read-hygiene.md
(C-DEGRADE-1); tasks/WP05-status-transition-pregate.md (T021-T023).

    Before this fix, ``degrade_ref = coord_branch or
    get_feature_target_branch(...)`` was computed unconditionally at the top
    of ``_resolve_write_target`` — the ``or`` only short-circuits on a
    *truthy* ``coord_branch``, so every mission WITHOUT one in hand (all
    SINGLE_BRANCH/LANES topologies, and even coord-topology callers that
    genuinely have no ``coord_branch`` handy) paid for a REDUNDANT eager call

    ``resolve_placement_only`` already makes internally to build its
    ``CommitTarget`` (``resolution.py:1332`` — unconditional, unavoidable,
    and not part of this fix). Old behavior: 2 calls (1 discarded). Fixed
    behavior: 1 call (the port's own).
