"""FR-005 destroy-step fault injection: persist-before-destroy on both paths.

The shared seam ``teardown_coordination_topology`` must persist the
retrospective to its durable PRIMARY home (``kitty-specs/<slug>/retrospective
.yaml``) BEFORE it destroys the coordination worktree — with persist running
OUTSIDE the destroy best-effort swallow. These tests inject a fault at the
DESTROY step (force ``CoordinationWorkspace.teardown`` to raise) on BOTH the
merge cleanup path AND the mission-close / ``--discard`` path, and assert the
retrospective already exists despite the destroy failure.

Red-first evidence: on pre-WP04 code the destroy ran first (or no persist ran at
all), so the assertion ``retrospective.yaml exists after a destroy fault`` was
RED. After WP04 it is GREEN because the seam persists first, outside the swallow.

Design (NFR-002): the fault is at the DESTROY step (not persist) on a
genuinely-divergent coord topology (the coord worktree never materialized — only
the primary ``kitty-specs/<slug>/`` home exists), with a real ULID mission_id and
a pending (not-yet-written) retrospective. The persist leg is exercised through
the REAL ``run_retrospective_postcondition`` authority; only the heavy generator
(``_invoke_capture``) is stubbed to write the durable record the way a real
capture would, so the home-resolution + write-before-destroy ordering is real.
