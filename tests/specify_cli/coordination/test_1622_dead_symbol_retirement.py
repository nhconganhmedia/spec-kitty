"""Regression lock for GitHub issue #1622 — coordination.status_service dead-symbol debt.

Resolution history
------------------
Mission 01KTPKST WP09 (commit be932d19a, approved 2026-06-09) resolved the bulk
of #1622 by delivering 2/5 deletions:

* ``append_event_log_batch`` — truly dead, zero callers → **deleted**.
* ``read_wp_lane_actor`` — truly dead, zero callers → **deleted**.

The remaining 3 symbols (``StatusReadSource``, ``EventLogWriteTarget``,
``StatusContractError``) are **load-bearing live internals** of the kept facade:

* ``StatusReadSource`` is the ``.source`` field type of ``EventLogReadContract``.
* ``EventLogWriteTarget`` is the ``.target`` field type of ``EventLogWriteContract``.
* ``StatusContractError`` is raised by ``read_event_log`` and ``append_event_log``.

Re-deleting any of the three breaks the live facade and ``test_status_transition.py``.
The prescribed remedy was de-exporting from ``status_service.__all__`` (the
dead-symbol gate's canonical fix for orphan-``__all__`` entries with live callers),
not deletion.  They were de-exported in the same WP09 commit.

This module locks that resolved state so a future reader cannot accidentally
"re-retire" the remaining three symbols.  The tests below are non-fakeable:
they assert the exact module shape AND exercise the live runtime guard.
