"""WP04 (T018/T019/T021) — commit_router placement-decision campsite.

Covers the ``coordination/commit_router.py`` side of the WP04 strangle:

* T019 — ``_planning_commit_worktree`` was RENAMED to
  ``_resolve_commit_worktree_for_kind`` (the old name lied post-D2: planning
  never transits coordination). The historical name is preserved as a
  backward-compatible alias (``mission.py``'s re-export shim and several
  existing unit tests key off the literal old name) — both names must resolve
  to the SAME function object, and the PRIMARY-kind invariant guard (a
  primary kind must NEVER reach the coord-staging body, even under coord
  topology) must survive the rename byte-for-byte.
* T021 — the ``CommitRouterResult.status`` outcome vocabulary
  (``"committed"`` / ``"unchanged"`` / ``"no_op_wrong_surface"`` / ``"error"``)
  is promoted from scattered string literals to named module constants
  (Sonar S1192); ``commit_for_mission`` must still PRODUCE the exact same
  string values through the constants.
