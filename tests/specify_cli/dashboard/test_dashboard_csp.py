"""Tests for the dashboard's Content-Security-Policy header (specify_cli.dashboard.csp).

Fixture rows map to m1-contract-drafts/D2.md §4: D3 (CSP present, identical
on every route) and D4 (CSP would block an inline script even if the narrow
grammar were defeated — defense-in-depth, second control layer).

This module covers the constant + shared helper (D2.md §5 WP03's "owned
data" piece, §3.3) AND, per D5 below, the structural proof that
``send_csp_header()`` is actually wired into every ``send_response()`` call
site across ``handlers/{base,api,features,glossary,lint,static}.py``
(WIRE-M2-02, HIC-M1-D5-DOMCSP) — closing what was previously tracked as
separate, still-open WP03 wiring work.
