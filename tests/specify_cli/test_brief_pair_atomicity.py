"""Pair-atomicity regression for the brief + source sidecar write.

The intake brief is two files: ``.kittify/mission-brief.md`` and
``.kittify/brief-source.yaml``. Each individual file write is
``open + fsync + replace``-atomic, but a kill between the two
``os.replace`` calls leaves the pair in a half-written state. The
first review of mission ``stability-and-hygiene-hardening-2026-04``
caught this as P2.5: ``write_brief_atomic`` performed two separate
atomic file replacements, so a kill between them could leave
``mission-brief.md`` present without ``brief-source.yaml`` (FR-010
honoured per-file but not pair-atomic).

The fix renames ``source.yaml`` FIRST and ``brief.md`` SECOND, so
the brief acts as the commit marker for the pair. The reader
(:func:`specify_cli.mission_brief.read_brief_source`) treats
``source-without-brief`` as ``None`` (no brief) so the partial state
is invisible to callers.

These tests pin the new ordering and the reader's tolerance.
