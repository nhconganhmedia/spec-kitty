"""Routing regression for the shipped writing-comms agent profiles (FR-005, NFR-002, SC-004).

Non-fakeable form (contracts/routing-behavior.md): the registry is populated from the
**real shipped** ``packs/built-in/agent_profiles/`` YAML — not a ``MagicMock`` and not the
router-test ``FIXTURES_DIR`` stubs. A mock hand-feeds ``role``/``priority`` and would pass
regardless of the shipped YAML; copying the shipped files into the project layer of a real
``ProfileRegistry`` pins the narrowed YAML, so each scenario also asserts the shipped
``profile.role`` (e.g. ``diagram-daisy.role == "diagram-author"``).

The two negative regressions (R-1 DESIGNER, R-2 CURATOR) are RED on the relocated-but-not-
narrowed tree (``roles[0]`` still ``designer``/``curator``) and GREEN after the T004 role
narrowing removes the writing-comms profiles from those canonical-verb buckets.
