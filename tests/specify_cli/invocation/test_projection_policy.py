"""FR-010 / NFR-005 — POLICY_TABLE coverage + resolve_projection contract.

Tests cover:
- T033: projection_policy module (T035 coverage tests)
- T038: golden-path regression — existing timeline behaviour preserved

All 16 rows of POLICY_TABLE are tested individually via parametrize, plus
golden-path assertions for rows that govern existing dashboard behaviour (3.2.0a5).
