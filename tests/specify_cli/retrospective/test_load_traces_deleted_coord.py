"""WP06 (FR-006) — ``_load_traces`` degrades on a deleted coord branch.

``retrospective/generator.py::_load_traces`` reads ``TRACER_FILE`` through
``mission_runtime.placement_seam(...).read_dir(...)``. That call resolves the
coordination surface for a coord-topology mission and raises
:class:`~specify_cli.coordination.surface_resolver.CoordinationBranchDeleted`
(a :class:`~specify_cli.missions._read_path_resolver.StatusReadPathNotFound`
subclass, #1848 data-loss signal) when ``meta.json`` declares a
``coordination_branch`` that no longer exists in git and no coord worktree is
materialized on disk.

``_load_traces`` is documented best-effort (FR-007 docstring: a tracer that
cannot be read is skipped, not a generator crash). Per C-READ-1
(``contracts/degrade-and-read-hygiene.md``), a deleted coord branch must
degrade the SAME way — ``generate_retrospective`` completes with ``[]``
traces rather than propagating the exception. Today (pre-fix) the
``read_dir`` call is unwrapped, so the exception propagates through
``_load_traces`` -> ``generate_retrospective`` uncaught. Scope (C-003): this
guards ONLY the single ``_load_traces`` call site — it must NOT widen to a
bare ``Exception`` and must NOT touch the ~50-module read-side set tracked
under #2922.

Landing-fold follow-up (P2): the bare ``except ... return []`` originally
carried no log line and no record marker, so a deleted-coord degrade was
indistinguishable from a mission that genuinely has zero tracer files — both
yield ``trace_evidence == []``. The generator now emits a ``WARNING`` naming
the mission and its declared ``coordination_branch`` on the degrade path.
``test_generate_retrospective_degrades_on_deleted_coord_traces`` below
asserts that warning fires; ``test_generate_retrospective_zero_traces_on_healthy_surface_logs_nothing``
is the discriminating sibling — a healthy, coord-less mission with no
``traces/`` directory also yields ``trace_evidence == []`` but must NOT log a
warning, proving the log line tracks surface-unreachability and not mere
absence of tracers.

# Mission Spec — trace deleted coord

## User Scenarios

### User Story 1 — Read traces best-effort

As an operator, I want retrospective generation to degrade gracefully when
the coordination branch is gone.

## Requirements

- **FR-001**: Retrospective generation must not crash on a deleted coord branch.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: `generate_retrospective` completes with empty traces.
