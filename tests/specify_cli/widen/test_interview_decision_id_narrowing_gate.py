"""Mypy gate: shared narrow-once decision_id seam (#2675 / WP07 T060-T061).

Before WP07, ``specify_interview.py`` and ``plan_interview.py`` each carried
a byte-identical block: an intermediate ``_already_widened`` bool computed
from ``current_decision_id is not None``, followed by re-passing the still
``str | None``-typed ``current_decision_id`` into
``render_already_widened_prompt(decision_id: str)``. mypy cannot carry a
narrowing through a stored bool, so both call sites raised a
``str | None -> str`` ``arg-type`` error.

T061 replaced both local blocks with a single call into
``specify_cli.widen.interview_helpers.resolve_already_widened_prompt``,
which narrows ``decision_id`` once and gates the
``render_already_widened_prompt`` call directly on the narrowed parameter
(no intermediate stored bool). This test pins that fix at the mypy level so
a regression to the old per-file pattern (or a new per-file duplicate patch
that narrows twice instead of consolidating) is caught immediately.

Environment requirement: this test invokes mypy via ``sys.executable -m
mypy``, which requires the ``lint`` extra to be installed in the test env
(e.g. ``uv run --extra test --extra lint python -m pytest ...``).

Note: ``widen/interview_helpers.py`` MUST be included in the mypy
invocation alongside the two interview files. The project's blanket
``[[tool.mypy.overrides]] module = ["specify_cli.*"] follow_imports =
"skip"`` treats a ``specify_cli.*`` module's exported symbols as ``Any``
when that module is only *imported* (not itself passed on the command
line) — which silently hides the ``decision_id`` arg-type error. Omitting
``interview_helpers.py`` from the invocation would make this gate pass
vacuously even with the bug present.
