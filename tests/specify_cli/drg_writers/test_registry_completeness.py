"""Completeness gate for the DRG writer registry (mission ``doctrine-delivery-reachability``).

The registry (``specify_cli.drg_writers.registry``) enumerates every site that
persists ``DRGNode`` / ``DRGEdge`` / ``DRGGraph`` state, so a field added to a
model later cannot be silently dropped by a writer nobody remembered to update.

These tests **iterate the registry** — they carry no hand-written list of
writers. Verification is by *mutation*: a fully-populated instance carrying a
field the writer does not restate must survive every member, and the failure
message must name the offending member and the dropped field (contract W-5).

Subtask mapping:
- T004 — structural: the three tuples exist, carry the documented members, and
  every member has a unique, stable ``name``.
- T005 — W-1 / W-1a for the mapping writers (``project_drg`` was the unguarded
  one; ``rewrite_opposed_by`` restates its keys and drops a *novel* field).
- T006 — W-2 for the document writer.
- T007 — the subclass-based mutation fixture, iterated across every registry
  shape, asserting the failure names the member.
