"""#1718 Fix C — transitional coord-topology read-path resolution.

Covers the window between ``mission create`` (which declares a
``coordination_branch`` in ``meta.json``) and the first coord write (which
materializes the ``-coord`` worktree). A *read* in that window must resolve to
the primary checkout — where the bootstrap status events live — rather than
fail closed because the declared coord worktree does not exist yet.

WP05 (coord-empty Option B / #1716 / FR-003): the materialized-but-empty coord
worktree NO LONGER fails closed. The read-path leg adopts WP01's
``probe_coord_state`` (the same discriminator the canonical surface uses) and
returns the PRIMARY checkout for the EMPTY state — matching the surface's loud
primary fallback — so every resolver leg converges. The genuine data-loss hazard
(the declared coord branch DELETED from git) is the case that still hard-fails,
now via the distinct ``CoordinationBranchDeleted`` type.
