"""Unit tests for the guarded read-side seam ``resolve_handle_to_read_path``.

WP01 (IC-01; FR-001, FR-004, FR-005-invariant). These tests pin the five
behaviours the seam must guarantee:

(a) a canonical ``<slug>-<mid8>`` / full-id handle resolves the SAME directory as
    :func:`resolve_mission_read_path` called directly (the seam is a faithful
    super-set, not a divergent re-implementation);
(b) a bare slug whose coordination worktree EXISTS on disk resolves to the coord
    directory (mid8 derived from primary ``meta.json``);
(c) a coordination branch that is DECLARED in primary ``meta.json`` but NOT yet
    materialised on disk resolves to PRIMARY — the #1718 trap cell. The derived
    ``mid8`` is non-empty (proving derivation is orthogonal to the existence
    gate), yet the seam still returns primary because no coord worktree dir
    exists. Routing through ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`` instead would
    compose+return the (non-existent) coord path and FAIL this case;
(d) a traversal handle is rejected at ``assert_safe_path_segment`` BEFORE any
    path composition (FR-004);
(e) a coord-DECLARED topology with NO derivable mid8 fails closed with the typed
    :class:`StatusReadPathNotFound` (M5) — never a silent stale-primary read.

Fixtures use realistic test data (NFR-005): a real 26-char Crockford ULID and the
real ``.worktrees/<slug>-<mid8>-coord/kitty-specs/<slug>-<mid8>/`` on-disk layout.
