"""Mypy gate: config-verified redundant cast removed (#2675 / WP07 T062).

``resolve_planning_read_dir`` is defined in the SAME module as its caller
(``_read_path_resolver.py``), so its declared ``-> Path`` return type was
always visible to mypy at the call site inside
``resolve_subtasks_gate_dir`` — unlike the follow_imports=skip cross-module
cases the removed cast's stale rationale comment described. Passing the
source through ``cast(Path, ...)`` was flagged ``redundant-cast`` under the
canonical mypy invocation; T062 dropped the cast, deleted the stale
rationale comment, and removed the now-unused ``cast`` import.

This test pins that the file stays mypy-clean (regression guard against a
reintroduced redundant cast, or an unrelated typing regression at the same
call site).

Environment requirement: this test invokes mypy via ``sys.executable -m
mypy``, which requires the ``lint`` extra to be installed in the test env
(e.g. ``uv run --extra test --extra lint python -m pytest ...``).
