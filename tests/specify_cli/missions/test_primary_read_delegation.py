"""WP03 T020 (WP08 T035 update): equivalence + divergence pins for the PRIMARY read seam.

Mission ``read-side-seam-primary-primitive-closure-01KYKMMT`` WP03 (Half B,
FR-003 / NFR-001 / NFR-002 / NFR-003). After T019, the (now-deleted, WP08
T035) public wrapper ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` delegated to
``mission_runtime.placement_seam(...).read_dir(PRIMARY_METADATA)`` instead of
composing the ``KITTY_SPECS_DIR`` join itself. This module proves that
delegation answer-preserving across the eight real-repo fixtures from
``quickstart.md`` §4, by comparing:

* the **blind composition** — the module-private leaf
  :func:`~specify_cli.missions._read_path_resolver._compose_primary_feature_dir`,
  which is the EXACT pre-T019 body of the (now-deleted) wrapper
  (topology-blind, handle-blind, no recovery); against
* the **seam's answer** — ``placement_seam(...).read_dir(PRIMARY_METADATA)``
  directly (:func:`_seam_read` below) — the ONLY spelling of "the topology-
  aware PRIMARY read" after WP08 deletes the wrapper it used to reach through.

Every divergence is attributed to exactly one of: **anchoring / backfill
recovery / husk / raising** (never absorbed silently). The single ACCEPTED
behavioural delta is the seam's bare-``<slug>`` backfill recovery (NFR-003) —
every other fixture must resolve IDENTICALLY, and a PRIMARY-partition kind
must never raise on husk / empty-coord / deleted-coord (NFR-002).

read-side-seam-primary-primitive-closure-01KYKMMT WP08 (T035): the wrapper
itself is deleted (SC-001), so the two tests whose ENTIRE subject was the
wrapper's own delegation identity/code-object (rather than the surviving
seam's behaviour) were DELETED per DIRECTIVE_041 (PATCHWORK — the shape they
pinned no longer exists to be pinned):

* ``test_backfill_recovery_pin_is_red_under_the_pre_delegation_wrapper_body``
  monkeypatched THIS module's own ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` binding
  to prove the backfill-recovery assertion above was genuinely falsifiable
  under the pre-delegation (Half A) body. With the wrapper gone there is no
  module-level binding left to revert or patch.
* ``test_read_dir_never_enters_the_public_wrapper_for_any_kind`` traced
  ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission.__code__`` via ``sys.setprofile`` to prove
  ``read_dir`` never re-entered the wrapper (the NFR-009 cycle WP03 closed).
  There is no wrapper code object left to trace, and the cycle it guarded
  against is now structurally impossible: every site that used to reach the
  wrapper either calls the seam directly (which never calls back to a
  deleted name) or calls the leaf directly (which imports no seam at all).

No resolver is patched anywhere in the equivalence fixtures below — every
scenario is a real git repository + real filesystem state (production-shaped
identities, per the project's NFR-003 test-data convention), built under
pytest's ``tmp_path`` (never a bare ``/tmp`` path).
