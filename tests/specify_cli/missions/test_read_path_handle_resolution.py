"""WP04 / IC-03 regression coverage for the read-path handle resolution.

These tests reproduce the e2e findings this mission drains:

* **F-001 / F-003 / F-004** — a bare ``mid8`` handle (e.g. ``01KTPKST``) must
  resolve to the *same* mission directory as the full ``<slug>-<mid8>`` form. The
  pre-fix resolver joined the mid8 to ``kitty-specs/<mid8>`` literally and
  returned a wrong-but-plausible (non-existent) directory.
* **C-CTX-4 / C-009** — an ambiguous handle (matching more than one mission)
  raises a *structured* :class:`MissionSelectorAmbiguous`
  (``MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR``), never a silent fallback to one of the
  candidates.

The single read primitive is ``resolve_mission_read_path``; the consolidated
``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`` re-export must inherit the same behaviour
(C-005: one resolver), so it is exercised here too.
