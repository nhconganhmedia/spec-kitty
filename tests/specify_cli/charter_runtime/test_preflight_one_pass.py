"""#2157a: one-pass charter-preflight prerequisite gate (WP04; re-pointed at
``charter.yaml`` by consolidate-charter-bundle WP06 / #2759).

Before this fix, ``_derive_blocked_reason`` (``preflight/runner.py``) picked
only the FIRST non-passing check among the charter-owed chain
(``charter_source -> synced_bundle -> synthesized_drg``), so an operator with
multiple simultaneously-broken prerequisites had to fix one, re-run
preflight, discover the next, and repeat. This module locks in the fix:
``blocked_reason`` now enumerates EVERY non-passing check in one pass.

WP06 re-pin: the original ``synthesized_drg``-value tests here exercised the
#2759 config<->derived activation-parity read
(``_activation_parity_drift_reason``), which consolidate-charter-bundle
retires outright (moot once freshness hashes ``charter.yaml`` directly —
activation relocates INTO that same file, see
``test_freshness_activation_visibility.py``'s module docstring). Those two
tests are replaced with equivalents that tie the same "real,
non-content-identity-cascade ``synthesized_drg`` staleness is correctly
enumerated" value to the surviving mechanism: a direct ``charter.yaml``
content edit.

Covers:

- ``test_blocked_reason_enumerates_all_non_passing_checks``: T014 red-first
  repro -- construct >=2 simultaneously non-passing checks and assert ALL of
  them (not just the first) are named in ``blocked_reason``. Written against
  the DESIRED (post-fix) behaviour, so it is RED against the unmodified
  ``_derive_blocked_reason`` and GREEN after the T015 fix.
- ``test_single_failing_check_blocked_reason_unchanged`` /
  ``test_all_pass_blocked_reason_still_none``: behaviour-preserving pins --
  the all-pass and single-failing-check outcomes are byte-for-byte identical
  to the pre-fix format.
- ``test_multi_failure_per_check_verdicts_pinned``: R-07 guard -- aggregation
  is additive only; no per-check verdict (state/remediation) changes because
  another check also failed.
- ``test_blocked_reason_schema_stays_a_single_string``: OUTPUT-SHAPE PIN --
  ``blocked_reason`` stays a single ``str | None`` field on
  ``CharterPreflightResult`` (``result.py`` is not owned by this WP).
- ``test_end_to_end_charter_yaml_edit_surfaces_in_report``: ties a real,
  content-hash-driven ``synthesized_drg`` staleness to value -- correctly
  surfaced by the one-pass aggregation.
- ``test_content_hash_driven_check_enumerated_alongside_another_failure``:
  exercises ``_derive_blocked_reason`` directly with a REAL content-hash-
  driven ``synthesized_drg`` check plus a synthetic second failure, because
  the freshness computer's own cascade rule (the content-hash comparison is
  only reached once ``synced_bundle`` is independently fresh) makes it
  structurally impossible to combine a genuine content-hash-stale
  ``synthesized_drg`` with an independently-stale ``charter_source``/
  ``synced_bundle`` through ``compute_freshness`` alone.
- ``test_c004_fence_analysis_report_not_invoked``: the analyzer-freshness
  gate (``check_analysis_report_current``, #2157b) is a different subsystem
  and must not be touched by this fix.
- ``test_refresh_command_prefix_is_hoisted_shared_constant``: campsite
  (S1192) -- the ``spec-kitty charter``-rooted refresh commands
  (``synthesize`` / ``bundle validate``) share a hoisted
  ``["spec-kitty", "charter"]`` prefix constant instead of repeating the
  literal (their tails differ). H1 (#2831 HIGH finding) moved the refresh
  sequence's step one off a hardcoded ``charter sync`` (a pure staleness
  reporter that can never create/repair ``charter.yaml``) onto the
  freshness-computed ``charter_source`` remediation instead -- which may or
  may not sit under this same prefix (``spec-kitty upgrade --yes`` does
  not) -- so this constant is no longer shared by all refresh-sequence
  commands, only the two that always do.
