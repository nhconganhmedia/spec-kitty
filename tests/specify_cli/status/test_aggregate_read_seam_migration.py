"""WP07 T033: behaviour-preservation + backfill-recovery pins for
``status/aggregate.py::MissionStatus._find_meta_path`` and ``MissionStatus.save``.

Mission ``read-side-seam-primary-primitive-closure-01KYKMMT`` WP07 (FR-001 /
FR-004 / NFR-001). ``_find_meta_path`` routed 2 of its 3 ``primary_feature_dir_
for_mission`` sites (``:499``, ``:543``) through ``placement_seam(...).
read_dir(MissionArtifactKind.PRIMARY_METADATA)``; ``save()``'s diagnostic-path
site was routed identically. The third site (``bare_dir_name = resolve_bare_
modern_mission_dir_name(...)``) is deliberately left calling the
module-private ``_compose_primary_feature_dir`` leaf (WP08, T035,
re-pointed here when the public wrapper was deleted) rather than the seam —
see the in-code rationale and the WP07 handoff report for why (a PERMANENT
canonicalizer-gate allow-list fixture predating this mission).

Since ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` already delegates to
``placement_seam(...).read_dir(PRIMARY_METADATA)`` (WP03 T019), routing a call
site to the seam directly is behaviourally a no-op TODAY — these tests exist to
PIN that equivalence (NFR-001) so a future change to either the wrapper or the
routed call sites cannot silently diverge, and to prove the ``:543``
backfill-recovery case (T033(b), US3 scenario 3) resolves an EXISTING
directory rather than a composed-but-absent one.

No resolver is patched — every scenario is a real git repository + real
filesystem state (production-shaped identities, NFR-003's test-data
convention), built under pytest's ``tmp_path``.

    primary read authority (the same "primary is the one read authority"
    invariant :func:`_backfilled_primary_dir` documents on the write/seam
    side).

    Fixture: a genuinely in-progress mission whose LANE BRANCH already
    carries the composed ``kitty-specs/<slug>-<mid8>/meta.json`` (checked
    in, real git), while ``main`` -- and therefore the primary checkout --
    has not merged it yet (a completely ordinary "implementation is still in
    a lane worktree" state, not a contrived fixture). Querying
    ``MissionStatus._find_meta_path`` with the BARE human slug from INSIDE
    that lane worktree:

    1. ``bare_dir_name = resolve_bare_modern_mission_dir_name(repo_root, ...)``
       (``:525``) globs the RAW ``repo_root`` (the worktree) verbatim and
       finds the lane's own composed dir -- entering the ``:526`` block.
    2. ``:541``'s ``_compose_primary_feature_dir(repo_root, bare_dir_name)``
       calls ``get_main_repo_root(repo_root)`` internally (the worktree ->
       main-checkout pointer follow), so ``composed_primary`` lands on
       ``main_repo/kitty-specs/<composed>`` -- NOT the worktree's own
       ``kitty-specs/<composed>`` the name was found through.
    3. ``main_repo/kitty-specs/<composed>/meta.json`` does not exist (the
       mission has not merged yet), so ``:543``'s ``composed_meta.exists()``
       is False and the function falls through to the topology-aware
       ``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`` leg instead of returning the
       worktree's local file.

    The net, black-box-observable behaviour this proves: a lane-local
    ``kitty-specs/`` copy is NEVER read as if it were the primary truth --
    ``_find_meta_path`` resolves (or degrades) entirely off the PRIMARY
    checkout, exactly as the coord/primary partition doctrine requires. No
