"""DRG proofs for `action:research/*` nodes (mission research-composition-v2 WP03).

These tests assert two facts on the *real* shipped DRG:

1. Each of the 5 research action nodes exists in the validated graph.
2. ``resolve_context()`` returns a non-empty ``artifact_urns`` set for each
   action when called with the same composition depth that
   ``StepContractExecutionContext.resolution_depth`` defaults to.

The mission spec (C-007) explicitly forbids mocking
``charter.activation._drg_helpers.load_validated_graph`` or
``charter.offering.drg.query.resolve_context`` in real-runtime tests. These tests
read the on-disk graph and call the production resolver directly.
