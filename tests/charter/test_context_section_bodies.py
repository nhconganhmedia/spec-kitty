"""WP04 unit tests — ``render_critical_section_bodies`` (FR-001).

These tests exercise the pure renderer in
``charter.activation.context_renderers.section_bodies`` against the five-row table
in the WP04 task spec (subtask T018).  They pin:

* verbatim section bodies surface when the heading is present;
* missing sections degrade to the fetch + when-doing stanza (no crash);
* action-specific section sets are honoured;
* unknown actions yield no block (empty string).

    When renaming an identifier-bearing term, the reviewer MUST grep the
    diff for the old term and MUST consult ``docs/context/`` before
    approving.
