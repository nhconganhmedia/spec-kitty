"""Gate test for the #2787 ``context_schema_version`` contract ledger.

Pins two invariants of ``charter.activation.context_contract``:

1. Every ``build_charter_context_json`` payload — bootstrap action AND
   non-bootstrap action — carries a top-level ``context_schema_version``
   equal to :data:`~charter.activation.context_contract.CONTEXT_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
2. Every top-level key either payload carries is a declared member of
   :data:`~charter.activation.context_contract.CONTEXT_CONTRACT_TOP_LEVEL_KEYS` — a
   *superset* guard, not strict equality, because the exact key set is
   conditional on the action (bootstrap vs. non-bootstrap) and on
   charter/doctrine state. An undeclared key escaping the ledger must red
   this test rather than pass silently.

Uses the same "copy the checkout's activated charter into an isolated
tmp project" fixture pattern as ``test_every_load_delivery.py`` so both a
real bootstrap render (``implement``) and a real non-bootstrap render
(``tasks``) resolve against genuine doctrine, not a hand-rolled stub.
