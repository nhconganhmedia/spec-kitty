"""WP04 T023 — glossary-pack default-on + generic cascade end-to-end.

Covers the two DoD items T023 owns:

* **Default-on, no manual activation** (FR-007, SC-003): with a project that
  has never run ``charter activate``, the built-in ``spec-kitty-core``
  glossary pack still resolves as *active* through the same
  ``PackContext`` -> ``filter_graph_by_activation`` seam every other
  built-in artifact kind uses. A negative control (an explicit
  ``activated_kinds`` list that omits ``glossary_packs``) proves the
  positive assertion is not vacuous.
* **Generic cascade** (FR-009): ``spec-kitty charter activate/deactivate
  glossary-pack spec-kitty-core --cascade all`` round-trips through the
  existing CLI + engine + cascade seam with NO glossary-pack-specific
  branch anywhere in that path (per the WP04 boundary: cascade is
  kind-agnostic, driven entirely by DRG `requires`/`suggests` edges).
