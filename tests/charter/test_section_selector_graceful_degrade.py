"""WP05 unit + integration tests — section selectors graceful-degrade (FR-010).

Pins the fix for **#3095** (its terminology-canon twin **#3094**, and its
code-review-checklist twin **#2552**): ``charter context --include
section:terminology-canon`` / ``section:code-review-checklist`` — required
by the generated ``implement``/``review`` prompts — used to dead-end with
``ValueError("No charter section found for selector ...")`` whenever the
charter carried no verbatim heading for those sections. A freshly-compiled
pack's seeded ``charter.md`` (``_CHARTER_MD_COMPANION_SEED`` in
``specify_cli.cli.commands.charter.generate``) is exactly such a charter —
it is a minimal starter that does not author either heading, so this bug
fired on every fresh pack (masked in-repo only because this repository's
own hand-authored ``.kittify/charter/charter.md`` happens to carry both
headings — a false-green per ``research.md`` Decision 1).

The fix lives entirely in
``charter.activation.context_renderers.section_bodies.render_critical_section_include``:
both of its ``return None`` sites for a *recognized* critical-section slug
(``if body is None: return None`` when the heading is absent from the
charter content, and the historical dead-end this fed at
``context.py:354``) now yield an honest, non-fabricated placeholder instead
of ``None`` — the selector always resolves to *something usable* (FR-010 /
SC-007) without inventing governance content (#2808-safe).

Coverage:

* T041a/b — ``render_critical_section_include`` returns a non-``None``
  placeholder for both ``Terminology Canon`` and ``Code Review Checklist``
  when the heading is absent (the ``if body is None: return None`` site).
* T041c/d — returns the real verbatim body when the heading is present.
* T041e — the placeholder text is honest: it names the missing heading and
  points at the real authoring surface (``.kittify/charter/charter.md``),
  never fabricating governance content.
* T041f/g — integration: ``build_charter_context_include`` (the
  ``charter context --include section:<id>`` engine, ``context.py:342``)
  resolves ``section:terminology-canon`` and ``section:code-review-checklist``
  to a rendered string — never raises "No charter section found for
  selector" — against a charter.md seeded from the *real* production
  ``_CHARTER_MD_COMPANION_SEED`` (a genuinely fresh, minimal pack's
  companion, not this repo's hand-authored charter.md, which would
  false-green per the bug's own root-cause analysis).
