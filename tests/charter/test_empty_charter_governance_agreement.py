"""Red-first governance-agreement test (WP03, #3064).

Contract: ``kitty-specs/charter-delivery-finish-context-degod-01KYT4BY/
contracts/empty-charter-fallback.md`` ("Governance-context agreement" section)
and ``research.md`` Decision 4.

Verified leak (pre-WP03): ``_render_compact_governance`` ->
``render_compact_view`` (``charter/compact.py:216-230``) merges
``resolver_directives`` from ``resolve_project_governance`` into the
``Directive IDs:`` block, independent of the profile. Under a wholly-empty
charter, ``_resolve_directives_selection`` (``charter/resolver.py:233-260``)
catalog-falls-back to the FULL built-in ``DIR-###``/``DIRECTIVE_###`` canon,
so an unadjusted generic-agent dispatch leaks every built-in directive.

This test reproduces the real dispatch seam end-to-end at the charter layer:
it calls ``resolve_generic_fallback`` (WP02, the composite empty-charter
predicate) first, exactly as ``executor.py`` does at its auto-route branch,
then feeds the resolved ``profile_id``/``action``/``suppress_project_resolver``
(``decision is not None`` -- the same boolean ``executor.py`` names
``empty_charter_fallback``) into ``build_charter_context`` exactly as
``executor.py:288`` does post-T013. This is RED before T013 (the leak) and
GREEN after it lands the bounded suppression.
