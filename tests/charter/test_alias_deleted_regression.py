"""Regression tests: resolve_governance alias must be fully deleted (WP04 / DRIFT-1).

AC-5 (slice-f-multi-context-extensibility-01KRX5C8):
  The bare symbol ``resolve_governance`` is a DRIFT-1 back-compat alias that
  was retained after the canonical name ``resolve_project_governance`` was
  introduced.  HiC §5a.1 (C-003) mandates clean removal with no
  DeprecationWarning, no sunset comment, no shim.

These tests are the RED gate:
  - Before WP04 GREEN: both tests fail because the alias still exists.
  - After WP04 GREEN:  both tests pass because the alias is gone and all
    test fixtures have been migrated to the canonical name.
