"""WP15 — progressive disclosure of doctrine context (ADR 2026-07-28-1).

Complete delivery made affordable: everything reachable is either delivered
inline (``requires`` — eager) or named with the guidance that says when to fetch
it (``suggests`` — a link carrying ``when``), never silently absent. This is the
default cadence, and it must be in force before WP11 switches on delivery on
every load (C-012).

The properties under test:

* **T081** — each artefact DTO carries ``references[]``; each entry is
  ``{id, relation, when, reason}`` from the edge, unmodified. Uncovered
  ``suggests`` edges render a *stated default* for ``when``, never a blank.
* **T082** — ``requires`` targets are delivered inline (eager); ``suggests``
  targets are emitted as links (lazy). This is the default cadence, not a mode.
* **T083** — ``--include-all`` materialises the entire reachable closure inline;
  its output is a superset of the progressive render for the same grain.
* **T084** — the union of inlined ids and referenced ids equals the delivered
  set (completeness by naming, no cap); a linked artefact is retrievable by its
  id via the existing ``--include`` verb; ``--include-all`` output ⊇ progressive.

    The built-in doctrine graph ships in the installed package, so only the
    project-local activation surface (``.kittify/charter`` + ``config.yaml``)
    needs copying for the action bundle to resolve exactly as it does in the
    checkout.

    ``mission_type_activations`` is unrelated to the progressive-disclosure
    delivery contract this module pins, but WP04 (C-A1) made it a hard
    construction precondition for ``PackContext.from_config``. The checkout's
    own charter.yaml now carries that provisioning key (emitted by the charter
    generation path — ``charter.activation.compiler.provision_mission_type_activations``),
    so the COPY inherits it with no fixture-side append. Every test in this
    module resolves the ``software-dev`` grain, which is one of the provisioned
    built-in mission types. (Mirrors the fixture in
    ``tests/charter/test_every_load_delivery.py``.)
