"""Scope: charter directive interpolation of the operator's documentation_policy answer.

Drives the public ``compile_charter`` generation surface (the same entry the
``spec-kitty charter generate --from-interview`` CLI invokes) and asserts that the
operator's ``documentation_policy`` answer is interpolated verbatim into the
generated ``charter.md`` Project Directives section, mirroring ``risk_boundaries``
(FR-001), while an absent answer emits no directive line (FR-002). Closes #2153.
