"""WP11 — governance is in force on *every* context load (FR-010, FR-012).

The defect these tests pin: activation reaches the boundary on the **first**
load and then evaporates. The second (steady-state) render fires a compact
early-return *before* the action-doctrine bundle is computed, so an agent that
reloads context mid-work package sees zero directives, zero tactics, zero
styleguides, zero toolguides — governance declared, not in force.

Four control-flow sites carry the bug (T060): the two ``build_charter_context``
returns (non-bootstrap action / depth-below-minimum) and the **two** in
``build_charter_context_json`` — the ``--json`` path is where the reproduction
is observed and where SC-001/002 are measured. A second, independent gate on
the same integer (``_EXTENDED_CONTEXT_DEPTH``) drops styleguides and toolguides
out of the *bootstrap* render entirely (T059): at the delivered depths (d=1,
d=2) the extended tier never renders.

SC-001/SC-002 are asserted through the **shipped** command surface
(``spec-kitty charter context``), not by calling ``build_charter_context``
directly — a test that supplies the grain itself proves nothing about the CLI
(T063, US3 scenario 9).

NFR-007 (T064) — steady-state render latency, measured on this branch (median
of 5, ``software-dev`` implement grain, this checkout):

    BEFORE (empty compact, pre-FR-010): ~1002 ms
    AFTER  (delivers the full bundle):  ~2052 ms   (~2.05x)

This matches the plan's recorded ~982 ms → ~1.94 s baseline. Per the operator
ruling 2026-07-28 the ~2x regression is **accepted, not gated**: this WP adds no
caching obligation (the memoization option is on record in the plan for a later
mission). The figures are recorded so a *later* regression is distinguishable
from this accepted one.
