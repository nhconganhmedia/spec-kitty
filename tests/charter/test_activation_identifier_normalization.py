"""Activation identifier normalization at a single boundary (WP06, I-V4 / C-009).

The activation store holds a directive as ``025-boy-scout-rule`` while the
selector / DRG-node form is ``directive:DIRECTIVE_025``. WP06 reconciles the two
forms at **one** boundary (:func:`charter.activation.pack_context.normalize_activation_identifier`)
and partitions the activated-but-unreachable set into
``{not-a-node, node-but-unreachable}`` so that the ~25-artefact swing the
normalization produces is **declared and excluded** from any reachability-progress
claim (C-009 — normalizing the identifier form is *not* SC-005 progress).
