"""Fixture-workflow builders for the WP04 invariant fault-injection suite.

Mission ci-suite-map-bind (Wave 0), WP04. The invariant suites in
``test_marker_job_completeness.py`` / ``test_workflow_coherence.py`` each
need a *synthetic* workflow that VIOLATES the parsed relation they guard, to
prove the invariant reds (ATDD fault-injection), plus a benign *reordered*
twin to prove refactor-stability (the FR-010/FR-012 red-negatives).
Centralising the builders here keeps the fault construction named, reusable,
and out of the assertion bodies.

Retired (planning#57): ``test_src_filter_coverage.py`` — formerly a third
consumer of these builders — was retired and deleted alongside the leftover
pre-programme ``.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml`` it asserted against (see
PROGRAM.md §2). The two consumers listed above never read a real workflow
file, so they and these builders stay.

These builders emit the *minimum* workflow shape ``_gate_coverage``'s parser
reads for the relation under test — never a copy of the live 3,200-line
``ci-quality.yml`` (that would be the literal-mirror C-002 forbids).
