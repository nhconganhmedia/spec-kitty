"""Architectural guard: dossier emitters must never be called positionally.

This mission (``legacy-cleanup-split-dossier-queue-migration-01M0MGHB``,
FR-008) closes the defect class PR #1056 had to patch around by hand:
``emit_snapshot_computed`` and its siblings drifted their positional
parameter order out from under a caller that still passed bare positional
arguments, and the mismatch was silent until runtime. WP01 promoted every
dossier-emitter parameter to keyword-only at the call sites this repo
controls, but nothing *enforced* that shape — a future edit could reintroduce
a positional call and nothing would catch it until the next drift incident.
This guard closes that gap by construction (spec.md User Story 3): it fails
CI if any production code under ``src/`` calls ``emit_artifact_indexed``,
``emit_artifact_missing``, ``emit_snapshot_computed``, or
``emit_parity_drift_detected`` with a positional argument.

**What this guard covers**: every ``*.py`` file under ``src/`` (production
code only), scanned via ``ast.parse()`` for ``ast.Call`` nodes whose callee
resolves to one of the four dossier-emitter names, flagged when
``node.args`` (positional arguments) is non-empty. Callee resolution
(``_call_target_name``) handles three call shapes:

- bare ``Name`` calls (``emit_x(...)``) — matched directly on the name.
- attribute-chain calls (``module.emit_artifact_indexed(...)``, e.g. via
  ``specify_cli/dossier/__init__.py``'s re-export of the four emitters) —
  matched on the final attribute name (``.attr`` of the outermost
  ``ast.Attribute`` node), regardless of chain depth.
- single-level, same-file import-alias calls (``from ...dossier.events
  import emit_artifact_indexed as ei`` followed by ``ei(...)``) — the
  alias is resolved back to its original imported name via a syntactic
  ``ast.ImportFrom``-alias map built once per file (``_build_import_alias_
  map``) before comparing against the guarded name set.

**What this guard still does NOT cover** (the widened detector's real,
current boundary — spec.md's Edge Cases section):

- ``tests/`` and any other non-``src/`` path (test fixtures may legitimately
  construct throwaway positional calls to exercise error paths; policing
  them is out of scope and would be a false-positive risk for no benefit).
- No full call-graph/data-flow resolution beyond the three shapes above.
- Alias reassignment after binding — e.g. ``ei = emit_artifact_indexed``
  followed later by ``ei = something_else`` — is not tracked. The alias map
  is a syntactic same-file ``ImportFrom``-alias lookup, not data-flow
  tracking, so a rebound name is invisible to it.
- Dynamic/reflective dispatch — ``getattr(module, "emit_artifact_indexed")
  (...)``, a dispatch-dict table keyed by name, or a ``functools.partial``
  -wrapped emitter — is invisible to this detector; it performs syntactic
  AST matching only, never runtime reflection tracking.

Modeled directly on this repo's own established AST-guard idiom:
``tests/architectural/test_shared_package_boundary.py``'s
``_forbidden_imports()`` + planted-violation positive-control pattern.
