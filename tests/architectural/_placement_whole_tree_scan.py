"""Shared whole-tree ``src/`` scanner for the placement-enforcement gates (WP06).

FR-001 / IC-02 (coord-write-placement-closure-01KYCF83): the write-side
placement-enforcement gate in ``test_no_write_side_rederivation.py`` (and its
``target=CommitTarget(...)`` companion assertion in
``test_safe_commit_import_boundary.py``) retired the 17-module
``_CHECKOUT_GRAMMAR_MODULES`` allowlist in favour of scanning **every**
``.py`` module under ``src/`` — a module allowlist is exactly the kind of
blanket escape a future write surface could hide behind. This module is the
ONE walker + sanctioned-set accessor both gates (and WP07's read-placement
gate, IC-05) import, so there is a single canonical notion of "the whole-tree
scan scope", never a second fork of the walk logic.

Pure helper — carries **no** gate assertions of its own (no ``test_*``
functions, no ``pytest`` import) so it can be imported by any consumer,
including a plain module walk from outside the test-collection machinery.

Sanctioned-primitive exclusion set
-----------------------------------
``BOUNDARY_SANCTIONED_MODULES`` is the **existing** (relocated, not
duplicated) sanctioned-primitive collection: coord primitives / legacy
migration bookkeeping that are NEVER a mission-artifact write site awaiting a
placement-seam route — they ARE the sanctioned grammar (branch composition,
worktree resolution, seam internals, migration bookkeeping, generic
non-mission-artifact commit surfaces). Each entry is now a
``{rel_path: rationale}`` mapping (was a bare ``frozenset[str]`` before WP06)
so every exclusion carries an inline, enforceable justification — see
``test_no_write_side_rederivation.py``'s
``test_sanctioned_modules_carry_a_rationale`` meta-test.

``BOUNDARY_SANCTIONED_PREFIXES`` is RETAINED byte-for-byte from the
pre-widening scope (do not add a new dir-prefix entry — a new prefix is how
the retired module allowlist creeps back in inverted form; see
``test_checkout_grammar_boundary_excludes_sanctioned_modules``'s pinned-tuple
guard).
