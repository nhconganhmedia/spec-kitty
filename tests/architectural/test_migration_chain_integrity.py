"""Migration chain integrity gate (Mission B / Process Gap 2 follow-up).

The Mission B post-merge architecture review surfaced that:

* 78 migration files at ``src/specify_cli/upgrade/migrations/m_*.py`` are
  auto-discovered via ``pkgutil.iter_modules`` and self-register via
  ``@MigrationRegistry.register``.
* They are grandfathered as "glue, not active code" by
  ``tests/architectural/test_no_dead_modules.py`` (category 1).
* But there is **no systematic gate** that proves the migration chain is
  consistent -- that walking from the oldest supported migration through
  every migration in semver order lands on a version aligned with the
  current ``pyproject.toml`` baseline.

This test is that gate. It complements ``test_no_dead_modules.py``:

* That gate proves every migration module is importable (auto-discovery
  fires, the registry populates).
* This gate proves the registered migrations form an uninterrupted chain
  of monotonically increasing target versions, with no major-version gap
  that would silently break a long upgrade hop.

Algorithm
---------

1. Auto-discover all migrations via
   ``MigrationRegistry.get_all()`` (calling ``auto_discover_migrations()``
   first if the registry is empty).
2. Sort migrations by ``target_version`` using semver order
   (already guaranteed by ``get_all()``).
3. Walk the chain starting at ``OLDEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION = "0.0.0"``
   (the implicit FROM of the first migration -- the upgrade runner does
   not declare an explicit minimum, so the chain definition itself is
   the source of truth).
4. For each consecutive pair ``(prev, cur)`` in target-version order:

   * **patch-skip** (same X.Y, ``cur.micro > prev.micro + 1``) -- WARN.
     A patch release may have shipped with no migration if no schema
     change was required. Example: 0.6.5 -> 0.6.7 skipping 0.6.6.
   * **minor-skip** (same X, ``cur.minor > prev.minor + 1``) -- HARD FAIL,
     unless the jump is in the documented ``_KNOWN_LINE_JUMPS`` set.
     A skipped minor line usually means a missing migration: a user
     upgrading from prev to cur would have no path through it.
   * **major-skip** (``cur.major > prev.major + 1``) -- HARD FAIL,
     unless the jump is in ``_KNOWN_LINE_JUMPS``.
   * **major-bump** (``cur.major == prev.major + 1``) and
     **minor-bump** (``cur.minor == prev.minor + 1``) are normal.
   * **patch-bump** (``cur.micro == prev.micro + 1``) is normal.

5. After the walk, assert that the chain's terminal target version is
   **not newer than** the project version from ``pyproject.toml``.

   * If the chain end is **behind** pyproject -- OK only when the release has
     no migration at its exact version.
   * If the chain end is **ahead** of pyproject -- HARD FAIL: a user upgrading
     to the current package version will not run that migration.

The ``_KNOWN_LINE_JUMPS`` set is the ratchet for legitimate historical
discontinuities (e.g. 1.x was never released; the codebase jumped
0.14.0 -> 2.0.0a5 deliberately). New entries require an explicit
rationale and should be rare.

See ``work/mission-b-post-merge-review.md`` for the assessment that
produced this gate.
