"""The owner never wins — the exempt member probe, and the control that makes the claim bite.

WP03/T013 + T014 (R1a). Binding contract:
``kitty-specs/isolated-home-pin-guard-r1a-01KZNMA3/contracts/canonical-home-owner.md`` §3a.

**SC-012 limb 2 AS SPECIFIED CANNOT FAIL, and that is recorded here as a spec finding rather than
silently repaired.** FR-005 forces the owner to pin ``str(tmp_path / "home")``; any member of the
behaviour class pins ``str(tmp_path / "home")``; ``tmp_path`` is function-scoped and **shared**
within a test. So inside one test those two strings are *the same string*, and the criterion's
*"fails if the owner's value is seen"* has nothing to distinguish. :func:`test_the_retained_pin_
probe_observes_its_own_value` is green **whether the owner won or lost**.

The repair is the second probe, and the pair is the point:

* **Probe (a)** — :func:`retained_pin_home`. Pins ``str(tmp_path / "home")``. It **is** a member of
  the behaviour class and therefore spends **one of ``E``'s two irrevocable, hash-pinned slots**.
  FR-011 mandates it, C-007 forbids widening the carve-out that pays for it, and that cost is this
  Mission's most irreversible decision. **Do not spend the second slot.**
* **Probe (b)** — :func:`probe_home_pin`. Pins ``str(tmp_path / "probe-home")``, **a value the
  owner can never produce**. It resolves to ``<tmp_path>/probe-home``, is therefore **not** a class
  member, costs **no slot**, and is **the only assertion in the pair that can be falsified**.
  Delete it and this module greens for an owner that overwrites every module's pin — the failure
  ``tests/conftest.py:272-286`` records having cost ~16 ``tests/sync`` cases.

Why the pin lives in a FIXTURE and not in a test body
------------------------------------------------------
Fixture setup completes **before** the test body runs, so a body-level ``monkeypatch.setenv`` wins
by ordering **unconditionally** and proves nothing about the *fixture-versus-fixture* precedence
decision at ``tests/conftest.py:272-286`` that this limb exists to demonstrate. Both probes
therefore declare their pin in a module-local fixture that **requests the owner as its first
parameter** — the required declaration order, asserted mechanically by
:func:`test_both_probes_request_the_owner_before_pinning`, not merely stated in this docstring.

``E`` is declared here-adjacent, in ``_home_pin_exempt.py``
------------------------------------------------------------
``E``'s two keys are determined by this WP's own two artefacts and nothing else: the canonical
owner (T011) and probe (a) above. WP04 tests the exemption **mechanism**; WP05 asserts the **real**
hash and runs mypy over the declaring module. No package edits another's.

No ``ast.parse`` and no ``NodeVisitor``: this module imports ``_home_pin_scan``, so WP02's seam
guard polices it, and every parse routes through :func:`_home_pin_scan.parse_module`.
