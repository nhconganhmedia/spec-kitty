"""Limb tests for the shared ``SPEC_KITTY_HOME`` scanning seam (WP01, R1a).

Every population in this module is an **AST set**, never a text search (C-003), and every
synthetic source is materialised into ``tmp_path`` at test time — **no synthetic tree is checked
in** (FR-009), because a checked-in tree would sit inside the classifier's own walk.

**This module never calls ``ast.parse`` and never subclasses ``ast.NodeVisitor``.** Every parse
routes through :func:`_home_pin_scan.parse_module`; a control that parsed directly would red the
anti-drift guard it exists to serve (contract §"Anti-drift mechanism").
