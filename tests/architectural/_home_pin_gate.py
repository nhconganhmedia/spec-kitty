"""The R1a window gate: two-SHA extraction, the rename detector, banding, ±1 stability, the walk.

Binding sources: ``spec.md`` §0.9 (the window, the banding, the ±1 rule, the amended widening
schedule), ``data-model.md`` §``Verdict`` and §Banding, and
``contracts/home-pin-scan-seam.md`` §"The gate driver is NOT in this module".

Why this module exists separately from the seam
------------------------------------------------
``subprocess`` and every git surface live **HERE and nowhere else** in the behaviour class.
``_home_pin_scan.py`` is imported by collected tests under a six-second budget on every PR
(NFR-001) and must stay clean of both; ``test_home_pin_seam_no_second_copy.py`` asserts that by
AST, with a positive control. This module is a **consumer**: it imports :func:`discover` and owns
**no predicate**, so the no-second-copy property is preserved.

It is also the seam's **first** consumer. FR-009's ``root`` parameter is exercised here — by a
``git archive`` extraction at each window SHA — before any downstream package depends on it, so
the two-SHA measurement is evidence the seam works rather than a claim that it will.

What ``R`` is, and why it is not simply ``discover()``'s difference
-------------------------------------------------------------------
§0.9 defines ``R`` as arrivals **within the effect class**: the sites *resolving to*
``tmp_path/"home"`` present at the end SHA and absent at the start SHA. ``R_f`` is the subset the
FR-001 predicate catches, i.e. the ``discover()`` members. So ``r = |R_f| / |R|`` measures exactly
one thing — the fraction of new effect-class sites whose scope chain *also* declares
``monkeypatch``. Drawing ``R`` from ``discover()`` alone would make ``r`` identically 1 by
construction and the instrument would measure nothing.

The effect-class enumeration below is a **composition of the seam's exported primitives**
(:func:`enumerate_py_files`, :func:`byte_prefilter`, :func:`parse_module`,
:func:`module_level_bindings`, :func:`find_write_sites`, :func:`bindings_for_site`,
:func:`resolve_value`, :func:`member_key`), never a second implementation of any of them.

Why ``git archive`` and not ``git worktree add``
-------------------------------------------------
``git archive`` writes nothing into ``.git``, needs no failure cleanup beyond a temporary
directory, and measured **0.46 s** per SHA against a ``discover()`` pass of **0.88-1.06 s**. A
worktree per candidate window would mutate repository state once per step of an unbounded walk.

Every population this module produces is an **AST set difference**. ``git log -S`` and
``git diff | grep`` are text search over a population and are barred (C-003); the only git this
module runs is ``rev-list --first-parent`` (history topology, not a population) and ``archive``
(content extraction).

The stopping rule
-----------------
:func:`window_accepted` reads ``|R|`` and ±1 consequence-class stability **only, never the value
of ``r`` and never the band**. That independence is the entire forking-path defence and it
survives the 5-attempt cap's removal untouched: a rule that read ``r`` would let a walker stop at
a convenient band. ``r`` has since leaked (§0.9 records it), which is exactly why the property
that matters is the rule's blindness rather than the analyst's.

# §0.3's "28 -> 30" IS SUPERSEDED.
#
# SUPERSEDED, in that word, and not "addressed" — §0.9 requires one of two words and the window
# has moved. The 28 -> 30 growth was measured under the SUPERSEDED decorator-limbed predicate
# across the STATED window ({stated_start} -> {end_sha}); neither endpoint is recoverable under
# the current predicate, so it cannot be re-derived at the moved SHA. §0.3 says so itself: "the
# class's growth under the current predicate is unmeasured, deliberately — measuring it at the
# window start SHA is WP-0's job."
#
# That job is done here, and its result is what supersedes the figure. Under the CURRENT
# predicate the effect class grows {selected_start_size} -> {end_size} across the SELECTED window
# ({selected_start} -> {end_sha}), and 37 -> 40 across the stated one. The 28 -> 30 figure is
# retained by §0.3 as the historical fact that motivated freezing and is labelled as such; it is
# no longer a statement about this Mission's window.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE MEASUREMENT HAS LEAKED, and the record says so rather than leaving a reader to infer it.
#
# While verifying the VOID finding, an independent lens measured r = 100% at candidate windows
# roughly 300, 600 and 2000 first-parent commits back (|R| = 9, 33, 34). On the published
# evidence the verdict was ALREADY KNOWN to be `proceed` before this run. WP-0b therefore
# CONFIRMS A KNOWN ANSWER rather than discovering one, and R1a must stop describing the gate as
# its own stopping mechanism: its power to halt this Mission was spent when the value leaked.
#
# What is PROTECTED is the stopping rule's independence from r. `window_accepted()` reads |R| and
# ±1 consequence-class stability ONLY; a leaked value cannot steer a rule that does not read it.
# What is LOST is the analyst's blindness, which was a real part of the instrument's value and is
# not recoverable. Both facts are stated because only one of them is.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The walk implements §0.9's AMENDED schedule: first-parent commits ONE AT A TIME (main is
# rebase-merged, so there are no merge commits to step over), NO ATTEMPT CAP, and a defined exit
# at the root of first-parent history where the OPERATOR decides. Every attempted window is
# published below, including the discarded ones, beginning with the VOID result at
# {stated_start} (|R| = 3 against a floor of 10). Lowering the floor to fit the window was
# refused by the operator.
