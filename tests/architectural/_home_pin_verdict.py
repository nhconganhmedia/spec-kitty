"""The R1a guard VERDICT seam: ``discovered == census u E`` plus the hash/tombstone limb.

Why this is a module and not a few helpers inside the guard's test file
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The verdict is a **shared primitive**. WP04 proves it over materialised trees; WP05 applies it to
the real tree; R1b drives the burn-down through its tombstone path. A primitive with three
consumers living in a leaf ``test_*.py`` is a **DIR-001 boundary violation**, and a peer work
package importing another work package's test module **inverts the dependency** — WP05 would take a
build-order edge on WP04's test file to reach a function that is not a test. That is the whole
reason; it is sufficient on its own.

*(Recorded correction. WP04's first pass justified leaving these helpers in the test module by
claiming an importer would inherit that module's ``pytestmark`` and fixtures. That claim is
**false** — importing a name from a module applies neither — and it should not be repeated. The
boundary argument above never depended on it.)*

The seam this parallels
------------------------
``_home_pin_scan.py`` exists because ``_sole_door_scan.py:13-27`` records Gates 4 and 5 each
rolling an independent, drifting copy of the same primitives as a **live incident**. That module
prevents a second copy of the *scanner*. This one prevents a second copy of the *verdict*, which is
the same failure one level up: nothing in the anti-drift rule bans duplicating the comparison, so
the ban would have been satisfied while the census/hash/tombstone semantics were re-derived from
scratch in WP05.

The two limbs, and why both are needed
---------------------------------------
``discovered == census u E`` alone does **not** close SC-006. Transition (7) — a 41st member
**accompanied by a new census row** — satisfies the equality by construction; the absorption path
walks straight through it. What refuses the addition is the **key-set hash pinned in the baseline**,
which no census edit can restore. FR-004 says this directly: exact accounting is the primary
ratchet, and "the hash pin and the tombstone list exist to catch the one thing exact accounting
cannot see, a removal with no adjudication behind it".

The tombstone rule, and exactly how much of it is normative
-------------------------------------------------------------
**The PROPERTY is spec-normative.** FR-004(b) requires "a checked-in hash of the sorted freeze-time
key set, plus an explicit tombstone list, so **removals require a tombstone and additions are not
expressible**", and ``spec.md:420`` requires that the guard "recomputes the baseline hash from the
census and compares, and every delta must be accounted for by a tombstone — so a co-edit that
removes a row *and* re-pins the hash still reds unless a tombstone explains it, while a legitimate
adjudication passes."

**The FORMULA is this module's choice**, and a downstream consumer should know that it is choosing
to inherit it: :func:`evaluate` spells the rule as

    ``hash_of_key_set(census_keys | tombstoned_keys) == baseline["census_key_set_sha256"]``

so the pinned hash is over the **freeze-time** key set and the census plus its tombstones must
reconstruct it. That satisfies all four of T018(ii)'s cases — an ``owed_to`` re-point and a header
edit pass, a row removed without a tombstone reds, the same removal with a matching tombstone
passes — but the spec does not mandate this particular arithmetic, and an equally faithful
mechanisation could pin differently. **WP05 and R1b inherit the caveat with the code.**

``E`` gets **no tombstone path at all**: any delta to ``E`` or its hash reds unconditionally,
because ``E`` never legitimately changes in R1a or R1b (FR-004(3)). That asymmetry is deliberate
and is asserted, not merely documented.

No pytest dependency
--------------------
This module is a seam, not a test. It imports ``_home_pin_scan``, ``yaml`` and the standard
library, and nothing else — so WP05, R1b and any future consumer can import it without taking on a
test-framework dependency. ``ast.parse`` and ``NodeVisitor`` are banned here as in every module
importing the seam; the verdict never parses anything itself.
