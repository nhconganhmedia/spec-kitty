"""NFR-003 / SC-004 — same-tier shard-selection uniqueness invariant.

Mission ``ci-topology-shrink-01KWQAVX`` WP02. Asserts no test is selected by
**> 1 fast shard** nor by **> 1 integration shard** (over the WP01 same-tier
relation :func:`_gate_coverage.same_tier_shard_counts`) — distinct from the
existing *report-only* cross-tier duplicate warning. The split must also drop
no test (``orphan_count`` stays 0, SC-004).

The invariant holds today: WP03 consolidated the shard roots, and it is
GREEN on ``main``. One fast-tier gate, ``fast-tests-corpus`` (#3008), is a
deliberate exception — it re-runs ``@pytest.mark.corpus`` reader tests under
a data-path trigger that is disjoint from the home shards' code-path
triggers, so its overlap with a home shard is intentional redundancy, not a
same-tier double-run. It is carved out of the uniqueness PEER set via
``_TRIGGER_DISJOINT_FAST_JOBS`` below; the invariant still bites on a test
selected by >= 2 *non-corpus* fast shards. Durable NFR-003 model
reconciliation (folding the overlay concept into the same-tier relation
itself) is tracked in #3315.

A fault-injection test additionally proves the relation BITES on a synthetic
double-run, independent of the live suite size.

Consumes only the additive WP01 relation; it does not re-derive the model.

Retired (planning#57): the three LIVE checks above (``test_no_test_selected_by_multiple_fast_shards``,
``test_no_test_selected_by_multiple_integration_shards``, ``test_split_preserves_zero_orphans``)
asserted the relation against ``_gate_coverage.load_gates()``, which parses the
real ``.github/workflows/*.yml`` — the leftover pre-programme GitHub Actions
YAML deleted per PROGRAM.md §2. With no workflow YAML left to parse, that half
(and the now-unused ``gates``/``universe`` fixtures backing it) has no
remaining subject matter and was removed with the files. The fault-injection
tests below never read a real workflow — each builds its OWN synthetic
``gc.Gate``/``gc.TestRecord`` objects — and stay as non-fakeable evidence that
``gc.same_tier_shard_counts`` itself still catches a planted same-tier
double-run.
