"""C-011's anchor key set, resolved once at the SHA ``members.json`` was authored against.

``members.json`` records each member as ``(path, qual, sites)`` where ``sites`` are **line
numbers**. Those line numbers are only meaningful in the tree they were read from. Resolving
them against any other tree is a category error: an upstream edit that inserts lines *above*
a member site leaves the recorded line number pointing at whatever moved into its place.

That is not hypothetical. Between ``fe5d492ed`` and this mission's landing base, upstream
inserted five lines into ``tests/cli/commands/test_sync_doctor_tracker_egress_3108.py``
above the site recorded as line 124. Re-resolving against the live tree read line 124 as a
**comment**, whose normalized token line is ``''`` — so the anchor silently reported a member
key that no census could ever match, and three set equalities plus two join lookups went red
for a member that had not changed at all.

Note that ``specify_cli.contracts.anchoring.composite_key`` used to document
itself as "content-addressed, not line-number-addressed" and "stable against
blank-line / comment-line insertions near the guarded site" — true of the key's
**values**, false of its **lookup**: the token line is fetched with
``tokens.get(lineno, "")``. Content inserted above the site moves the site, and
the key changes; the claim held only for insertions *below*. #3369 narrowed
that docstring to match this reality, which is why this freeze exists: the
recorded ``lineno`` values in ``members.json`` are only meaningful in the tree
they were read from.

So the resolution is frozen here, once, and checked in:

* ``members.json`` remains untouched and remains the sole authority on **which** sites are
  members — the one artefact this Mission did not write and must never edit to green a test.
* This file records only the **encoding** of those sites, computed by the repository primitive
  against the frozen SHA's blobs.

The consequence worth stating plainly: the anchor is no longer re-derived from the working
tree on every run, so it can no longer notice that a member site's code changed. It never
usefully could — such a change made it go red without saying why. What it still does, and what
C-011 actually asks of it, is assert the census's membership against an independently authored
list.

Regeneration needs the frozen SHA's blobs to be reachable, which is why it is a one-time
operation recorded in the artefact header rather than a step in any routine gate.
