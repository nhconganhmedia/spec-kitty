"""The anti-drift teeth over a **discovered** consumer set (WP02, T007, R1a).

Binding contract: ``kitty-specs/isolated-home-pin-guard-r1a-01KZNMA3/contracts/home-pin-scan-seam.md``,
§"Anti-drift mechanism (the teeth)". **The seam is not the import; it is the test that makes the
import the only option.**

This repository has the failure on record as a live incident, not as a hypothetical:
``tests/architectural/_sole_door_scan.py:13-27`` documents Gates 4 and 5 each rolling an
independent, drifting copy of the same primitives. Prose did not prevent it there.

Why the consumer set is DISCOVERED and never hard-coded
-------------------------------------------------------
A hard-coded list of consumer filenames greens the day a consumer is renamed — the guard then
enforces nothing while still reporting green. So the set is computed by AST at run time, and two
independent properties are asserted about it:

* it is **non-empty** (a matcher that sees nothing is indistinguishable from a matcher that
  passes), and
* it **contains** ``_home_pin_gate.py`` and this module itself — named members whose absence is a
  red rather than a silent hole.

WP03/WP04/WP05 modules are therefore covered **without editing this file**.

Why this module never calls ``ast.parse``
------------------------------------------
This module imports the seam, so it is a member of the very set it polices. Every parse routes
through :func:`_home_pin_scan.parse_module`; a positive control calling ``ast.parse`` directly
would red the guard it exists to serve, and the cheapest repair for that red is to exempt the
control — which reopens the seam. The contract states this explicitly because three separate
subtasks ship such controls.

Pre-filter, and why it is not the C-003 text search
----------------------------------------------------
File **selection** uses a raw-bytes containment test for ``b"_home_pin_scan"``. That is C-003
form (i): a pre-filter that over-selects by construction (any mention in any context, including a
comment or a string) and whose output is then decided **by AST**. No population this module
publishes is produced by text search.

What this cannot see
--------------------
A second copy of the predicate written **without importing ``_home_pin_scan`` at all**. That hole
is stated rather than papered over; closing it needs a similarity oracle, not an import graph.
