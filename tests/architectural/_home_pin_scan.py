"""The ONE importable scanner for the ``SPEC_KITTY_HOME`` behaviour class (R1a, WP01).

Binding contract:
``kitty-specs/isolated-home-pin-guard-r1a-01KZNMA3/contracts/home-pin-scan-seam.md``.

Why one module
--------------
``tests/architectural/_sole_door_scan.py:13-27`` records the drift this module exists to prevent
as a **live incident**: Gates 4 and 5 each rolled an independent, drifting copy of the same
primitives, Gate 4's copy having already lost Gate 1's docstring rationale. Prose did not prevent
it there. The seam is mechanised by WP02's guard, not asserted here in prose.

What lives here, and what deliberately does not
-----------------------------------------------
Here: the un-narrowed walk, the mandatory byte pre-filter, a parser that **propagates**
``SyntaxError``, the binding resolver, the key-parameterised receiver-agnostic write-site finder,
the scope-chain silhouette attributor, :func:`discover`, the census/baseline generators, and the
shared vocabulary (:data:`MemberKey`, :class:`Member`, :class:`Exempt`, :data:`INERT_LIMBS`) that
three downstream packages bind to.

Not here: **no ``subprocess``, no git surface** — the window measurement lives in
``tests/architectural/_home_pin_gate.py`` and *imports* :func:`discover`. Collected tests import
this module under a 6-second budget on every PR (NFR-001).

``except SyntaxError`` is forbidden in this module (SC-013). It narrows the walk with nothing
firing and buys budget headroom, which is NFR-001's defeat wearing an exception handler. The
absence is AST-asserted against this module's own source, with a positive control.

#: Raw bytes the mandatory pre-filter looks for (FR-002) — and the module's canonical form of
#: the key.
#:
#: **The byte form is primary deliberately, and this is a recorded finding.** SC-002b asserts
#: that the population of **assignment-bound string constants valued** ``"SPEC_KITTY_HOME"``
#: across ``src/`` ∪ ``tests/`` is **0** (against 229 literal occurrences in 98 files). A module
#: constant written the obvious way — ``NEEDLE = "SPEC_KITTY_HOME"`` — would make this file the
#: **first** such binding in the repository and falsify that population in the very module that
#: ships its assertion: the FR-009 "the guard's own artefact lands inside the guard's own
#: population" shape, operating on SC-002b instead of on the walk. The pre-filter needs the bytes
#: and the literal-key matcher needs the text, so the bytes are held and the text derived.

#: explicitly — comparing the two directly is a ``mypy --strict`` type error (C-012(0a)).

#: The second environment variable the walk resolves. It decides ``home_partition`` (FR-003),
#: never membership. **Its enumeration is a LIMB, not an inert sub-form** — 85 write sites in 50
#: files, 13 of the 40 members re-pinning it — so it is deliberately absent from
#: :data:`INERT_LIMBS`.
HOME_KEY = "HOME"

#: Symbolic stand-in for the per-test temporary directory in a resolved value. Values are
#: compared as strings against these symbols, so a synthetic tree and the real tree are
#: comparable without either one running.
TMP_PATH = "<tmp_path>"
#: The value that makes a write site a member.
TMP_PATH_HOME = f"{TMP_PATH}/home"
#: Partition B2's value (``research/m4_ablation_evidence/VERDICT.md:38-41``).
TMP_PATH_USER_HOME = f"{TMP_PATH}/user-home"

#: Parameter names counting as ``tmp_path`` for **both** the silhouette and value resolution
#: (FR-010). Without this limb the guard goes blind in proportion to R1b's adoption — the more
#: the owner is adopted, the more members become invisible — so the limb is correct to exist.
#:
#: **BUT IT MATCHES NOTHING TODAY, AND THAT IS STATED HERE RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE ASSUMED.**
#: FR-007's rule — *a limb matching nothing must be known to match nothing or it reads as
#: enforcement* — is applied by this package to fifteen ids in :data:`INERT_LIMBS`. This is the
#: sixteenth, and it is the one the rule was **not** applied to until review constructed it.
#: Measured over ``tests/``:
#:
#: * **``runtime_home``: population 0.** Removing it leaves ``discover()`` at 40 members with
#:   **symmetric difference 0**. Exactly one def in the tree declares the parameter —
#:   ``tests/audit/test_no_legacy_path_literals.py:80 _capture_nudge(module_name, runtime_home,
#:   *, argv)`` — and although it does enclose two ``SPEC_KITTY_HOME`` writes (``:94``, ``:112``)
#:   it is refused on **both** limbs: the chain union is ``{argv, module_name, runtime_home}`` so
#:   the silhouette fails for want of ``monkeypatch``, and the value resolves to ``<tmp_path>``
#:   (and to ``None`` at ``:112``), never ``<tmp_path>/home``. FR-010 cites this as "the live
#:   population-1 shape"; it is live as a *shape*, and population **0** as a member.
#: * **``canonical_home``: BOUND, and no longer population 0.** WP03 has landed the canonical
#:   owner, so the name is now declared by a real fixture at ``tests/conftest.py`` and the limb
#:   fires on the real tree. The entry was *provisional and unbound* when it shipped — the name
#:   was taken from FR-010's prose at a moment when no contract named the owner — and the
#:   closing obligation named here has since been discharged by **WP03/T012**, which parses the
#:   declared fixture name out of ``contracts/canonical-home-owner.md`` and asserts it is a
#:   member of this set (``tests/architectural/test_home_owner_behaviour.py``:
#:   ``test_the_declared_owner_name_is_a_member_of_owner_param_names``, with
#:   ``test_the_owner_alias_limb_actually_fires_on_the_owner_name`` constructing the effect
#:   rather than reading it). The operand is now outside this author's control, which is what
#:   closes the circularity: rename the owner and that test reds, instead of this limb going
#:   silently inert with every assertion in this package still green.
#:
#: Both entries are **kept**: deleting them would remove the limb R1b needs, and the defect was
#: never the limb — it was presenting an inert limb as a live one.
