"""Architectural: no production dep on retired ``spec-kitty-runtime`` package.

WP05 of mission ``stability-and-hygiene-hardening-2026-04-01KQ4ARB``
implements FR-025 (a constraint reaffirming the
``shared-package-boundary-cutover`` decision). The standalone
``spec-kitty-runtime`` PyPI package was retired; the runtime is now
internal under ``src/runtime/next/_internal_runtime/``.

This test asserts:

1. ``pyproject.toml`` does NOT list ``spec-kitty-runtime`` in
   ``[project.dependencies]`` or any production-flavored entry under
   ``[project.optional-dependencies]`` (test/lint/dev/docs extras are
   permitted; they are dev-only).
2. ``runtime.next.decision`` imports cleanly in a sub-process where
   ``spec_kitty_runtime`` has been hidden from ``sys.modules`` and
   ``sys.path``. This proves the production code path does not require
   the retired package even when one happens to be present in the dev
   venv.

Companion: ``tests/architectural/test_pyproject_shape.py`` covers the
related ``[tool.uv.sources]`` invariants from the cutover mission.

Retired (planning#57): ``test_ci_quality_does_not_install_retired_runtime_package``
asserted point 3 above LIVE against the real ``.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml`` —
the leftover pre-programme GitHub Actions YAML deleted per PROGRAM.md §2. With no
workflow YAML left to parse, that check has no remaining subject matter and was
removed with the file. Points 1-2 (the pyproject.toml dependency shape and the
sub-process import probe) never read a workflow file and stay as the
authoritative FR-025 guard.
