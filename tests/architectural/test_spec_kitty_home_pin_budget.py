"""SC-007: NFR-001's budget, the enumerated-set criterion, and both parallel modes (T021).

**This is the only module of WP04 that is not ``architectural``.**
``pytestmark = pytest.mark.timing`` and **nothing else**, so it routes to ``timing-nfr-serial``
(``-m timing -n0``, always-on, wired into ``quality-gate.needs``, merge-blocking) and is correctly
excluded from the ``arch-adversarial`` pole by that pole's ``and not timing``. A wall-clock
assertion belongs here and nowhere else: the pole runs under ``-n auto`` on 4 vCPUs, where a timed
assertion is the #2032 anti-pattern.

``time.perf_counter()``, never ``time.time()``
------------------------------------------------
``time.time()`` is in ``_BANNED_CALLS`` (``tests/_support/wall_clock_assertions.py:10-20``) and
``tests/conftest.py:245-250`` raises a ``pytest.UsageError`` **AT COLLECTION** — so the wrong clock
here does not fail this module, it takes the **whole suite** down.

Why the enumerated set is compared against an INLINE ``rglob``
----------------------------------------------------------------
**The cheapest way to meet a wall-clock budget is to narrow the walk.** The seam exposes exactly
one enumerator, so the natural assertion is ``enumerate_py_files(root) == enumerate_py_files(root)``
— a self-comparison a narrowed walk passes. The expected set is therefore computed by a
``Path(root).rglob("*.py")`` **written inline below**, never obtained from the module under test.
This is why the anti-drift rule bans ``ast.parse`` and ``NodeVisitor`` in the guard modules but
explicitly does **not** ban ``rglob``.

It is a **tripwire**, not a discovery: today both sides are an ``rglob`` and the assertion is
trivially true. Its whole value is future-facing — the day someone adds ``if "node_modules" in
path.parts: continue`` to buy budget headroom, this reds. Per OD-003 the budget may be **RAISED**
against a recorded runner figure with the contention headroom stated; **the walk may NEVER be
narrowed.**

What this cannot see
--------------------
The guard under contention. ``timing-nfr-serial`` measures it **uncontended** while
``arch-adversarial`` runs it under ``-n auto``, so the serial figure is a **FLOOR, not the worst
case**.

    under ``-n auto --dist loadfile`` and comparing the digest below across the two runs; this test
    exists to give those runs something to disagree about beyond "the suite passed". The earlier
    name claimed the cross-mode comparison and the docstring alone disclosed otherwise.

    **The digest is process-stable, and that is the fix that makes the comparison possible at all.**
    It was ``hash(frozenset(...))``, which Python randomises per process via ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` — so
    two identical serial runs printed different digests for the same 40-member class and the
    cross-mode comparison was meaningless. It now comes from the seam's own ``render_baseline``

    hash and reproducible across processes and machines.
