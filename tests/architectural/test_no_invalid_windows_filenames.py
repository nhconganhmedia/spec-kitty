"""Guard against Windows-illegal or shell-expansion-leak characters in tracked filenames.

Mission ``cmd-output-file-leak-guard-01KWVZX7`` (#2169), FR-003 / FR-004. A
test double once regex-parsed a shell-quoted ``--output=`` argument and wrote
the literal string ``"${SPEC_KITTY_CMD_OUTPUT_FILE}"`` as a filename into the
working tree. ``git add -A`` swept the junk file into a commit on PR #2161,
and ``git checkout`` then exited 128 on Windows CI (run 28224079685) because
``"`` is illegal in a Windows path component. This is the class-closing
backstop: it fails on *any* tracked path containing a forbidden character,
whether or not this specific leak (or its emitter) resurfaces.

Two distinct, deliberately-not-conflated forbidden sets:

1. ``WINDOWS_ILLEGAL_CHARS`` -- characters Windows itself refuses in a path
   component: ``< > : " \\ | ? *``. ``"`` is the exact character that broke
   #2161's Windows checkout. ``:`` is only legitimate as a drive-letter
   prefix (e.g. ``C:\\...``); no tracked, repo-relative ``git ls-files`` path
   is expected to carry one, so any ``:`` found here is also flagged.
2. ``SHELL_EXPANSION_TELLTALE_CHARS`` -- ``$ { }``. These are Windows-*legal*
   but their presence in a tracked filename is a shell-substitution-leak
   signature -- exactly this bug's ``"${SPEC_KITTY_CMD_OUTPUT_FILE}"``.

Cheap by construction: a single ``git ls-files`` call, no per-file I/O.
