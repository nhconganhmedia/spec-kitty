"""Frozen corpus fixture + non-vacuous shrink-only ratchet (#3396, WP08 T037-T040).

``find_bare_prose_requirement_ids`` (``src/specify_cli/requirement_mapping.py``)
is a detector, and per this mission's own founding defect class (a detector
that "counts 0 and calls it clean" is a silent-success failure), the detector
needs a regression net that CANNOT itself be silently green. This module is
that net.

**Frozen snapshot, not a live re-run (charter Standing Order 5 /
``frozen-baseline-shrink-only-ratchet``).** ``tests/fixtures/
bare_prose_corpus_baseline.json`` is a committed, point-in-time snapshot of
the live detector's output against the ``kitty-specs/*/spec.md`` corpus,
re-verified at this WP's implementation time (2026-08-14): ``N=368`` specs
scanned, ``1`` flagged (``kitty-specs/egress-refusal-consolidation-3110-
01KYW895/spec.md``, ids ``C-1``/``C-3`` -- a foreign-id citation, zero true
positives; see ``find_bare_prose_requirement_ids``'s own module docstring for
the full measurement record). This test module deliberately never
recomputes "1/368" or any percentage at CI time -- it only asks, per spec
path: did the flagged *set* grow, and is it still non-empty where the
fixture says it should be. A future, unrelated mission's new
``kitty-specs/*/spec.md`` cannot flip this gate red merely by existing
(assertion 1 passes vacuously for a spec with no bare-prose token); only a
*regression in the detector itself*, or a *newly bare-prose spec*, can.

Four assertions close the non-vacuity gap (PLAN-VERIFY-001 /
``architectural-gate-non-vacuity``) that a shrink-only-allowlist ratchet
alone would leave open -- a fully-collapsed, always-empty detector would
pass a bare subset/no-growth check trivially, reproducing inside this
mission's own regression net the exact silent-success class the mission
exists to fix:

1. **No growth** (``test_specs_outside_the_fixture_have_no_live_bare_prose_ids``):
   every spec NOT in the fixture has an empty live result.
2. **Shrink-or-equal, never grow** (``test_fixture_specs_live_ids_never_exceed_recorded``):
   every spec IN the fixture has a live ``flagged_ids`` result that is a
   subset of (or equal to) its recorded set.
3. **Concrete floor** (``test_fixture_specs_live_result_is_non_empty``): for
   each fixture spec, the live result is non-empty -- this is what a
   collapsed, always-``[]`` detector would fail, where it would pass (1)+(2)
   vacuously.
4. **Self-mutation teeth test**
   (``test_ratchet_fails_when_detector_is_stubbed_to_always_return_empty``):
   stubs the detector to always return ``[]`` and asserts assertion 3 above
   then FAILS (a real ``AssertionError``, not an error or a skip) --
   proving the gate is load-bearing, not merely present.

Growing the fixture requires editing ``tests/fixtures/
bare_prose_corpus_baseline.json`` in the same PR with a recorded reason,
mirroring ``tests/architectural/_baselines.yaml``'s per-PR edit policy
(read directly as this module's precedent) -- adapted from a bare integer
ceiling to a per-spec **signature**, since a bare count cannot distinguish
"the same specs are still flagged" from "different specs are now flagged".

This test walks the real, on-disk ``kitty-specs/*/spec.md`` corpus at run
time (read-only; no network access, no corpus writes) -- it therefore also
carries ``pytest.mark.corpus`` (registered in
``tests/architectural/test_ci_corpus_trigger_completeness.py``'s curated
module registry) so a corpus-only change (a new/edited ``spec.md`` with no
code change) still re-runs this gate.
