"""The COLLECTED gate: the verdict, the 806-state oracle, and the keys checked against this tree.

Binding sources: ``spec.md`` §0.9, ``data-model.md`` §``Verdict`` / §Banding, WP02/T008.

**This module is the gate that blocks every package.** It is a *collected*, ``architectural``-marked,
top-level test module — not "WP-a's first task", which gates only whichever package happens to be
sequenced first and which any concurrent package can skip.

Seven limbs, each independently falsifiable
--------------------------------------------
(a) reds when the verdict artefact is **absent**; (b) reds when it reads ``halt``; (c) passes only
for ``proceed`` / ``proceed-degraded``; (d) **recomputes** the band from the published operands and
asserts it equals the published label; (e) asserts internal consistency **as sets** and requires the
``start_sha_crosscheck`` to be present; (f) runs the full 806-state oracle as a **mapping**
comparison against thresholds transcribed inline from §0.9; (g) recomputes the surviving
``sites_at_end`` keys from this working tree against a published non-zero floor.

Why (b) and (d) exist at all
-----------------------------
A test asserting ``"verdict" in artefact`` passes for ``halt``. **(b)** kills that. A band that is
*published* rather than *recomputed* hides ``verdict: proceed`` written above ``r = 0.6``; **(d)**
kills that, and nothing else in the criterion set can.

No git, no subprocess in this module
-------------------------------------
C-003's containment: the window measurement, the extraction and the walk live in
``_home_pin_gate.py``. This module reads a committed artefact and this working tree. Measured cost
of limb (g): **0.19 s for 40 keys**.

What this cannot see
--------------------
The **start-SHA operands**, which name content that is not in this tree. Limb (g) raises the forgery
cost from *"consistent numbers"* to *"consistent numbers that are also real token lines at real line
numbers in this repository"*, but only for the end half. The start half remains unprovable without
git, and it is anchored instead by the ``start_sha_crosscheck`` the artefact publishes — which
(e) requires to be there rather than leaving it verified by nobody.
