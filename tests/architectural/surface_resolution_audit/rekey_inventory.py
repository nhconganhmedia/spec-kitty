"""Recorded converter / freshen tool for the surface-resolution ``inventory.md``.

This is the RECORDED CONVERTER referenced in the inventory header (IC-03 re-key,
mission ``refactor-stable-gate-substrate-01KWK3FY`` / FR-004). It regenerates the
two gated tables (the sink table and the read-SELECTION table) from the LIVE
``discover_rows()`` / ``discover_selection_callsites()`` scan so that every stored
``qualname`` + ``token`` identity is TOOL-DERIVED via ``composite_key_from_file``
— never hand-typed (data-model tool-derivation invariant).

Run to freshen after a legitimate seam edit::

    python tests/architectural/surface_resolution_audit/rekey_inventory.py            # regenerate
    python tests/architectural/surface_resolution_audit/rekey_inventory.py --check    # diff-only

The ``line`` in each locator is a NON-authoritative jump-to convenience; the audit
compares only the drift-proof ``(rel_path, qualname, token)`` composite, so a
``+1`` line drift never trips the tripwire (the #2306 failure class).

Dispositions are the established human judgements encoded as a rule
(``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` → topology-blind; the ``_coord_mid8`` raise
payloads → raw-bypass diagnostic; the seam-grammar output → routed; everything
else routes through the coord-aware resolver). Spot-check them against source.

# Mission-surface-resolution callsite inventory (WP01 / FR-003; IC-03 re-key FR-004)

Generated input: `python tests/architectural/surface_resolution_audit/audit.py`
walks `src/specify_cli` and `src/mission_runtime`. The audit tracks:

1. **All resolver/topology-blind calls inside the canonical seam source files**
   (`RESOLVER_SOURCE_STEMS` in `audit.py`).
2. **All raw-bypass path joins** (`KITTY_SPECS_DIR / slug`) anywhere in the
   source trees.
3. **All direct read-SELECTION callsites** (`resolve_mission_read_path`) via
   `discover_selection_callsites()` (FR-006a).

## Design-P: drift-proof identity + freshen procedure (IC-03)

> **Row identity is the `(rel_path, enclosing_qualname, token)` composite** derived
> by `composite_key_from_file` — NOT the `file:line` locator. The `line` in each
> locator is a NON-authoritative jump-to convenience and is **never compared**;
> a blank/comment-line insertion above a callsite shifts the line but keeps the
> composite identical, so the audit stays GREEN (the #2306 failure class is fixed).
> The `qualname` and `token` columns carry the frozen comparand; both are stored
> backtick-wrapped for readability and the audit parser strips the backticks.
>
> **Both tripwire directions are gated** (per audit, IC-02/03):
> - **Undercount** — every DISCOVERED callsite must match an inventory row by
>   composite identity, else RED.
> - **Overcount / ghost** — every inventory row (minus `[inventory-only]`-tagged
>   rows) must match a LIVE discovered callsite, else RED. A `[inventory-only]`
>   tag in the notes/rationale exempts a row that documents an intentionally
>   removed sink; each tagged row must cite the removing change. Zero rows are
>   tagged at conversion time.
>
> **Freshen procedure** (after a legitimate seam edit shifts these callsites):
> re-run the recorded converter
> `python tests/architectural/surface_resolution_audit/rekey_inventory.py`, which
> re-derives every `qualname`/`token` from live source (tokens are tool-derived,
> never hand-typed) and rewrites the two gated tables below.

**Scope note:** the many downstream callers that legitimately call
`resolve_feature_dir_for_mission` / `candidate_feature_dir_for_mission` /
`resolve_feature_dir_for_slug` outside the seam files are summarized in the
"Routed caller summary" section (aggregate, not gated row-by-row) — the matcher's
job is to make bypass under-counting and ghost over-documentation impossible, not
to enumerate every blessed call.

## Sink table

{sink_table}

## Disposition summary

| disposition | count | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| routed-through-resolver | {counts["routed-through-resolver"]} | goes through a canonical blessed resolver (cite it) |
| topology-blind-by-design | {counts["topology-blind-by-design"]} | deliberately primary-only; coord surface carries no meta.json (C-GUARD-3a) |
| raw-bypass | {counts["raw-bypass"]} | composes KITTY_SPECS_DIR/slug inline for a fail-closed diagnostic `raise` payload (no FS sink) |
| **total** | **{total}** | all AST-discovered ResolutionRow callsites |

## Read-SELECTION callsites (FR-006a)

`discover_selection_callsites()` enumerates every direct
`resolve_mission_read_path(...)` call — the read-side SELECTION authority.
Seam-internal calls are auto-blessed; external calls must be allowlisted in
`audit.py::ALLOWLISTED_SELECTION_CALLSITES`. The table is cross-checked by the
SAME composite undercount/overcount seams as the sink table. On the collapsed
tree all {sel_count} direct selection callsites are seam-internal (zero external).
