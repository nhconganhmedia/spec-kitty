"""The R1a synthetic-tree MATERIALISER (WP04/T015). **Never collected, and it asserts nothing.**

What this module is
-------------------
A file writer. It turns source **strings** into a real directory under a caller-supplied
``tmp_path`` root and returns a :class:`SyntheticTree` describing what it was built to contain.
Every guard behaviour in ``test_spec_kitty_home_pin_guard.py`` is exercised against one of these
trees through ``_home_pin_scan.discover(root=…)`` — FR-009's root parameter is what makes that
possible without editing a real test module.

Why nothing here is checked in under ``tests/``
-----------------------------------------------
Two independent reasons, either of which alone is decisive (FR-009):

1. ``enumerate_py_files`` is bound to **every** ``.py`` under the root and is **never narrowed**
   (C-003), and the real-tree pass roots at ``tests/``. These trees exist precisely to contain
   **41st members**, so a checked-in tree lands its deliberate extras in ``discovered`` and
   ``discovered == census u E`` can **never** green. Every cheap repair is separately barred:
   directory exclusion by C-003/NFR-001, a census row by C-007, a third ``E`` entry by ``E``'s
   fixed arity. *"Not collected" is a* **pytest** *property and says nothing about the
   classifier's walk.*
2. The deliberate ``SyntaxError`` tree (SC-013) would red ``ruff check`` with **``invalid-syntax``**,
   which is **not a rule code** — ``pyproject.toml``'s ``per-file-ignores`` cannot reach it and no
   ``exclude`` covers ``_``-prefixed directories.

Why this module holds NO assertions
------------------------------------
``pytest.ini`` sets ``testpaths = tests`` with **no ``python_files`` override**, so a module named
``_home_pin_synthetic.py`` is **never collected** and any assertion placed here would never run.
The materialiser's own correctness is proven in the collected module
``test_home_pin_synthetic_trees.py`` (T015), where a tree that silently fails to write a file reds
**there** instead of greening a transition downstream.

Why there is no ``ENV = "SPEC_KITTY_HOME"`` convenience constant
----------------------------------------------------------------
That would be an **assignment-bound string constant valued** ``"SPEC_KITTY_HOME"`` — the exact
population **SC-002b asserts is 0** across ``src/`` u ``tests/`` — and this module lives in
``tests/``. The pin appears here only **inside** the source strings below, where it is a fragment
of a larger literal and not the value of any binding, so ``_assignment_bound_key_hits`` does not
see it (T015(7)).
