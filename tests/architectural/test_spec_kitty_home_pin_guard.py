"""The R1a guard: the eight SC-006 transitions, SC-004, SC-013, and the ``E`` mechanism (WP04).

Everything here runs over **materialised** trees and **materialised** census/baseline artefacts, so
this package is green on its own branch without WP03 and without WP05. The real-tree
``discovered == census u E`` assertion is deliberately **not** here — it is WP05's, and that is
what buys the parallelism (FR-009).

The verdict itself lives in ``_home_pin_verdict.py``
-----------------------------------------------------
This module holds the **trees, the artefact doctoring and the assertions**; the comparison it
asserts over — :func:`~tests.architectural._home_pin_verdict.evaluate` and the census/hash/tombstone
semantics — is a shared primitive with three consumers (WP04 proves it, WP05 applies it to the real
tree, R1b drives its tombstone path) and lives in its own seam. Keeping it here would have left a
peer package importing a leaf ``test_*.py`` to reach a non-test function, which is a **DIR-001**
boundary violation and a dependency inversion. **Moving it must not move the teeth**: every mutation
in WP04's red-first campaign is re-run against the extracted seam and reds the same named assertion.

The guard is TWO limbs, and both are load-bearing
--------------------------------------------------
``discovered == census u E`` alone does **not** close SC-006. Transition (7) — a 41st member
**accompanied by a new census row** — satisfies the equality by construction: the absorption path
walks straight through it. What refuses the addition is the second limb, the **key-set hash pinned
in the baseline**, which no census edit can restore. So ``evaluate`` returns both, and (7) is red on
the hash while the equality is clean. Six of the eight transitions are equality reds, (7) is a hash
red, and (2) is the green.

Why the hash is over the KEY SET and not the file bytes
--------------------------------------------------------
``sha256(path.read_bytes())`` passes any "a hash exists" review and fails on day thirty: it moves
under an ``owed_to`` re-point and under a comment edit, neither of which touches the key set the
ratchet compares. T018(ii) therefore requires **all four** cases — the two legitimate edits must
**PASS** as firmly as the two illegitimate ones must red. A blanket "touching both reds" rule would
satisfy the reds and **forbid R1b's entire job**.

And the tombstone path is asymmetric, on purpose
-------------------------------------------------
A census row removed **with** a matching tombstone passes (that is R1b adjudicating a member away);
the same removal **without** one reds. ``E`` gets **no tombstone path at all** — any delta to ``E``
or its hash reds unconditionally, because ``E`` never legitimately changes in R1a or R1b.
