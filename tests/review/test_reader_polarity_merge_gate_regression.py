"""WP14 (FR-012/SC-012, T065/T066) -- declared reader polarity regressions.

Two regressions live in this file, both about a reader's behaviour on a
DAMAGED verdict record (non-UTF-8 content, or a malformed event-sourced
slot), and both about pinning an ALREADY-correct behaviour rather than
introducing a new one:

* T066 -- **superseded by WP05 (verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35,
  T028/FR-013/D-PLAN-8)**: the merge gate (``post_merge/
  review_artifact_consistency.py::find_rejected_review_artifact_conflicts``)
  is now pure-event -- it consults ONLY the reduced snapshot's event-sourced
  ``review_result``/``review`` slots and no longer resolves, opens, or
  parses any on-disk ``review-cycle-N.md`` artifact at all (see
  ``_terminal_event_conflict``'s docstring). The former accident this test
  pinned -- ``UnicodeDecodeError`` happening to subclass ``ValueError`` and
  landing in the gate's own ``except ValueError`` -- can no longer occur:
  there is no read of the artifact file left to raise it, and
  ``ReviewArtifactSchemaFinding`` (the malformed-artifact finding type this
  test originally asserted) is now unreachable dead code, retained only
  because an unowned caller (``cli/commands/review/_lane_gate.py``) still
  imports it. This test is REPOINTED (not deleted -- baseline-pinned, see
  ``tests/architectural/mission_exit_baseline.txt``) to pin the NEW
  guarantee instead: a genuinely damaged/non-UTF-8 ``.md`` file coexisting
  on disk with a real event-sourced rejection must neither crash the gate
  nor suppress the real finding -- the gate reports exactly the event's
  verdict, as a ``RejectedReviewArtifactFinding`` with ``artifact_path=None``
  (G2, contracts/verdict-authority-read.md: a safety-gate consumer never
  reads or is disturbed by artifact-file damage it no longer depends on).

* T065 -- ``review/arbiter.py::get_arbiter_overrides_for_wp`` was, before
  WP12 (T051-T053), an uncaught-crash site: a manual YAML/JSON parse of two
  non-durable override representations (frontmatter block + JSON sidecar)
  with no exception handling at all. WP12 retired BOTH representations
  outright (not narrowed in place) into the event-sourced ``ReviewOverride``
  read via ``wp_snapshot_state`` -- the surviving reader already wraps
  ``ReviewOverride.from_dict`` in a narrow
  ``except (KeyError, TypeError, ValueError)``. Verified directly against
  ``review/arbiter.py`` at this WP's base commit (WP14's Activity Log): the
  manual parse this defect lived in no longer exists in the file at all, so
  there is nothing left for T065 to fix in code. The two tests below pin
  that already-correct behaviour, and prove the narrow catch has not
  widened into a blanket ``except Exception`` that would also swallow a
  genuine programming error.

    the reduced snapshot's event-sourced verdict.
