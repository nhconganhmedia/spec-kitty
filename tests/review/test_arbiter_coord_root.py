"""FR-016 (WP07, arbiter-root-threading): the arbiter's caller-resolved
``main_repo_root`` must be threaded all the way into
:func:`specify_cli.review.arbiter.persist_arbiter_decision`, which must
NEVER self-infer it from ``feature_dir.parent.parent``.

The retired self-inference happened to coincide with the correct root only
for a SINGLE_BRANCH/LANES-topology mission -- the shape every pre-existing
test fixture for this path exercised. Under a *materialized coordination
topology*, ``_run_arbiter_override``'s own ``feature_dir`` is already the
caller's topology-resolved COORD surface (see ``tasks_move_task.py``'s
``_mt_issue_matrix_facts`` docstring: "the caller's already topology-resolved
COORD surface"), so ``feature_dir.parent.parent`` there yields the COORD
WORKTREE root -- not the real ``main_repo_root`` the downstream event-sourced
write needs to correctly resolve the coord partition. T036 proves this is a
real, materialized-topology bug (not merely a hypothetical), red against the
pre-WP07 self-inference; T037 is the threading fix; T038 confirms (without
repointing) that the arbiter's verdict READ path was already event-sourced
before this WP and stays that way.
