"""Regression tests for WP04 per-worker HOME/state isolation (FR-002, SC-006).

These tests lock the master-enabler guarantee: every xdist worker (and the
serial ``master`` run) resolves its OWN ``Path.home()`` so parallel workers
never share or truncate the real ``~/.spec-kitty/queue.db``.

Two properties are proven:

1. **Distinct homes** — two simulated worker ids resolve *different* home base
   directories (and the serial ``master`` id resolves a third). This is the
   anti-collision invariant; a session-only fixture would violate it.
2. **Real home untouched** — the real ``~/.spec-kitty`` is neither created nor
   modified by a worker run. We record its absence / mtime before, run an
   isolated worker, and assert it is unchanged after.

These directly support WP02's ``test_real_home_isolation_guard`` (that guard
flips from skip to active once this isolation fixture exists).
