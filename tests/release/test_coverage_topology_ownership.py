"""FR-006 coverage-topology emit-consume ownership guard.

Mission ``ci-topology-shrink-01KWQAVX`` WP05. Every CI job that *emits* a
``coverage-*.xml`` report must have that report *consumed* by the coverage
aggregator by construction — never by convention, never by memory. The
aggregator (``diff-coverage`` / ``sonarcloud``) consumes reports in two glob
steps: it ``actions/download-artifact``s every artifact whose *name* matches a
``pattern:`` glob (today ``*-reports``), then ``find``s every downloaded file
whose *name* matches a shell glob (today ``coverage-*.xml``). A shard that
uploads its report under a name outside the download glob, or writes a report
filename outside the ``find`` glob, is silently dropped from coverage with no
red — an invisible coverage hole exactly of the kind mission
``ci-topology-shrink`` exists to close.

This is a *distinct* silent-drop vector from WP02's C-005 needs-list membership
guard (formerly ``tests/architectural/test_coverage_consumer_needs.py``, retired
per planning#57 alongside the deleted ``ci-quality.yml`` it asserted against).
That guard asked "is the emitter in the aggregator's ``needs:`` list so the
aggregator waits for it?"; this guard asks "does the aggregator's
download/``find`` wildcard actually pick up the emitter's uploaded report
file?". A job can sit in the aggregator's ``needs:`` yet still upload under a
non-matching artifact name (or write a non-matching filename), and vice versa —
the two invariants were independent, so both were required to make coverage
drops impossible.

The coverage-emitting job set was cross-validated against the reused workflow
model in ``tests.architectural._gate_coverage`` (its public ``cov_targets``
relation): every emitter this guard detected was a model-recognised coverage
job. The step-level artifact detail the model deliberately does not carry
(upload artifact names, ``--cov-report=xml:`` filenames, the aggregator's
download ``pattern`` and ``find`` glob) was read through the model's own
``load_spliced_workflow`` reader of the same workflow file.

Retired (planning#57): the LIVE half of this guard (``load_coverage_topology``
and its ``_steps``/``_step_run_text``/``_emitter_upload_names``/
``_emitted_report_filenames``/``_discover_download_name_globs``/
``_discover_report_file_globs``/``_normalize_gha`` parse helpers, plus the six
``test_*`` functions that consumed the module-scoped ``topology`` fixture)
asserted FR-006 against the real ``.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml`` — the
leftover pre-programme GitHub Actions YAML deleted per PROGRAM.md §2. With no
workflow YAML left to parse, that half has no remaining subject matter and was
removed with the file. ``unconsumed_emitters`` — the pure emit/consume relation
— never read a real workflow; it stays, exercised only by the two RED-negative
fault-injection tests below, which build their own synthetic
``CoverageTopology``/``CoverageEmitter`` objects and prove the relation still
catches an unconsumed upload name and an unconsumed report filename.
