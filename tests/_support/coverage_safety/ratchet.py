"""Stability ratchet helper (T006, C-RATCHET, FR-012, NFR-005, E4).

A parallelization flip is accepted only after **N consecutive green** parallel
runs of the shard (E4/I1) with zero new flaky tests relative to the serial
baseline (E4/I2). This mirrors the repo's existing "run twice on an unchanged
tree" ratchet convention (see ``tests/architectural/test_no_op_stable_writes.py``)
applied to test-suite stability instead of tree cleanliness.

Design for testability: the per-run execution is injected as a *runner*
callable (``Callable[[Sequence[str]], RunOutcome]``). Unit tests pass a stubbed
runner so the aggregation logic is exercised without launching N real suites
(Risks & Mitigations). The default runner shells out to ``pytest -n auto``.

A thin CLI (`python -m tests._support.coverage_safety.ratchet ...`) makes the
ratchet runnable from CI.
