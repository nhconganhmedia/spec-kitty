"""Regression tests for stale back-compat symlink / architecture/ prose in ADR READMEs.

SC-006 backstop (WP07, doc-quality-hardening-2245-01KW9AKV):
The Common Docs structural move (PR #2225) removed the `architecture/` tree and dropped
the 71 back-compat symlinks that some README files claimed would exist.  These tests pin
the fix so future edits cannot silently re-introduce the false present-tense symlink claim.

Note: `tests/docs/test_adr_readme_prose.py` is outside the WP07 `owned_files` list
(`docs/adr/{1,2,3}.x/README.md`) but is a sanctioned small addition required by the WP's
DoD (Review Guidance item 8).  The no-overlap rule with other lanes is the real guard.
