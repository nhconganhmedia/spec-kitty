"""FR-004 propagation: a per-glob non-vacuity refusal must surface as ``CoverageError``.

``description_length_check`` does not decide publication for itself — it consumes the
shared resolver via :func:`scripts.docs.description_length_check._resolve_page_set`,
which catches ``(FileNotFoundError, ValueError)`` and re-raises
:class:`~scripts.docs.description_length_check.CoverageError` (exit 2). For that
translation to hold, the resolver's per-glob pre-exclusion guard (WP01/T002) MUST raise
``ValueError``: a non-``ValueError`` type would escape ``_resolve_page_set`` and crash the
gate with a traceback instead of failing it cleanly as a gate malfunction.

This test drives the empty-glob fixture through the *consumer's* own entry point to prove
the shared-resolver failure path is inherited, not just present in the resolver.
