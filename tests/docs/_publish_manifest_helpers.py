"""Shared primitives for the PR-time docsite publish-integrity gates.

Both gates in ``test_publish_manifest_coherence.py`` (#2357, #2360) reduce to
the same question, asked of two different inputs (a committed baseline URL, a
``docs/toc.yml`` href): *is this site-relative published-URL path resolvable
WITHOUT a DocFX build?* "Resolvable" means one of:

* **DERIVED** — the page still exists in the source tree, so
  ``capture_baseline_urls.derive_urls_from_source`` would (re-)produce it, or
* **REDIRECT-COVERED** — the URL is a key in the committed
  ``redirect_map.yaml`` **and** its redirect TARGET itself resolves (is
  DERIVED or a documented build-time-generated shape). This mirrors
  ``redirect_stub_generator.check_coverage``'s real, build-time invariant
  exactly: a stub is only real coverage when ``target_live`` holds —
  ``generate()`` refuses to emit a stub pointing at a 404 (the no-404
  invariant) and reports it as a ``dead_targets`` entry instead. A redirect
  whose target does not resolve is NOT coverage; the source path is reported
  uncovered, same as ``check_coverage`` would (post-build) via a missing
  stub.

This is a **static-tree approximation** of ``check_coverage``: the real gate
checks file presence inside an emitted ``_site``; DocFX/.NET is CI-only (see
``redirect_stub_generator`` module docstring), so PR-time cannot build one.
The approximation trades that live-build fidelity for running in every PR.
There is no known divergence left between this approximation's notion of
"covered" and ``check_coverage``'s: both require the redirect target to
resolve, not merely that the source is a mapped key.

Known model limit (documented in ``derive_urls_from_source``'s own docstring):
pages generated at build time from a non-static source — today, exactly
``kitty-specs/**/*.html``, emitted by ``generate_kitty_specs_docs.py`` from the
top-level ``kitty-specs/`` mission-spec tree, per the ``resource`` block in
``docs/docfx.json`` — are absent from a plain source-tree walk. Both gates
allowlist *only* that one documented shape (:func:`is_generated_at_build`);
anything else that is neither derived nor redirect-covered is a real gap.
This allowlist also applies when resolving a redirect TARGET (a redirect
could in principle point at a kitty-specs generated page), keeping the two
checks symmetric.

Separately documented known-limit (not a divergence from ``check_coverage``,
since ``docfx.json``'s ``overwrite`` block is not a publish source at all):
the ``overwrite`` block (``apidoc/**.md``) is not modeled by
``derive_urls_from_source`` and therefore not by this approximation either,
because ``docs/apidoc/`` is currently empty/inert — a future apidoc
population would need this revisited.
