"""PR-time docsite publish-integrity gates (#2357, #2360).

Two "no PR-time gate saw it" defect classes, closed by construction
(DIRECTIVE_043):

* **Gate 1 (#2357)** — a moved-away page can leave a committed baseline URL
  with neither a live page nor a redirect stub. The real NFR-002 invariant
  (``redirect_stub_generator.check_coverage``) only runs post-build in CI
  (DocFX is CI-only); this is its PR-time, build-free approximation: every
  baseline URL must be DERIVED (still resolvable from the source tree, see
  ``capture_baseline_urls.derive_urls_from_source``) or REDIRECT-COVERED (a
  key in the committed ``redirect_map.yaml``). This is exactly the class that
  broke the docsite deploy for a week on 2026-07-04 — an incomplete
  migration-runbook move left a baseline URL uncovered, caught only
  post-merge by the build-time gate.

* **Gate 2 (#2360)** — a ``docs/toc.yml`` nav entry can point at an
  unpublished path and ship a 404. In cluster 2, a "Release Goals" nav entry
  pointing at an unpublished path was caught only by adversarial review, not
  by any PR-time gate. This asserts every toc href resolves to a DERIVED or
  REDIRECT-COVERED published URL — the same "covered" test as gate 1, applied
  to the nav instead of the baseline.

Both gates share the static-tree "covered" primitive in
``tests/docs/_publish_manifest_helpers.py`` (``uncovered_urls`` +
``is_generated_at_build``'s narrow allowlist for the one documented
build-time-only generator, ``kitty-specs/**/*.html``).

Scope (intentionally tight): toc **href** coherence only — the witnessed
defect shape. Body-link publish-coverage (asserting every in-page markdown
link that targets another *published* page actually resolves) is a plausible
follow-on but is NOT covered here: distinguishing "link to a published page"
from "intentional cross-reference to an unpublished file" (e.g. a link to
this repo's own ``CONTRIBUTING.md``, a kitty-specs mission doc, or an
``architecture/adr`` symlink target) needs scoping work to avoid false
positives on the current tree, and that scoping was not attempted here. Left
as an explicit follow-up.
