"""Structural checks for the placement-seam architecture page (WP09, T044).

Contract: ``kitty-specs/read-side-seam-primary-primitive-closure-01KYKMMT/contracts/
placement-layering.md`` C1/C5. This suite asserts **structure and citations**, not
prose wording — pinning sentences would fight every future edit. The comprehension
check (does a fresh reader actually understand the layering) is User Story 7's
Independent Test, a human judgement call, not something this file can assert.

Also covers the companion edits from the same slice:
- the competing page (``branch-target-routing.md``) no longer asserts per-kind
  placement rules or the retired ``primary target branch`` alias (SC-017);
- the ``Routing`` disambiguation lives in ``docs/context/orchestration.md`` and
  covers every governed sense named by the WP prompt, each with a "do NOT use
  when" guard, plus the infrastructural senses named as explicitly out of scope.
