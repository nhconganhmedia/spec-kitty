"""The machine-global scope warning must stay in the env-var reference.

Regression cover for spec-kitty#3030. In the 2026-07-27 breach the operator
exported ``SPEC_KITTY_ENABLE_SAAS_SYNC`` into a shell — on our own advice — and
nothing in the documentation said that arming it there arms every project the
shell subsequently touches. The absent warning is why the shell was armed.

This test asserts on the *substance* (both variable names plus the phrase that
carries the meaning), not on a heading, because a heading anchor passes happily
against an emptied section.
