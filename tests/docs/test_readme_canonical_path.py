"""Regression tests for README canonical workflow path.

Ensures the README names `spec-kitty next` as the canonical agent loop
and does not teach `/spec-kitty.implement` or `spec-kitty implement WP##`
as canonical steps in any of the prominent workflow sections.

FR-501, FR-502 (WP06 — Track 6 de-emphasis)
Post-079 review findings: extend coverage to all workflow sections, not just
the first 30 lines.
