"""FR-004 (#3115): the forbidden remedy is proved forbidden, not asserted.

C-009: no fix for the `#3115` CLI half may work by normalising, collapsing or
stripping whitespace from rendered output before asserting on it.
`overflow="fold"` on `sync.py`'s `Project` column stays -- it exists
deliberately (`sync.py:1430-1436`) so a project identity is never ellipsized
into a prefix the operator cannot pass to `sync purge`. At console width 80
the fold puts the REST OF THE TABLE ROW between the two uuid fragments, so no
amount of whitespace-collapsing rejoins them. "Flatten the output and the
assertion passes" is the obvious wrong fix; this file closes it with a
measurement against a committed, provenance-carrying capture, not a sentence.

The two fixtures this file reads
(``tests/cli/commands/fixtures/render_width_3115/capture_width80.txt`` /
``capture_pinned.txt``) were produced by driving `sync status` through
`typer.testing.CliRunner`, seeded exactly like
`tests/cli/commands/test_sync_status_per_project_3030.py::_seed_contaminated_store`
(WP01/WP07's own reproduction shape), under `TERM=dumb FORCE_COLOR=1`: once
with no render-surface pin at all (the failing shape) and once with
`console.size = (240, 50)` set immediately before the invocation -- the same
pin `tests/conftest.py::_plain_cli_console_seam` applies (WP02, FR-002). Each
capture's sidecar (`*.provenance.json`) records the exact reproduction
script, the commit, the environment variables in force, and the observed
`Console.size` tuple -- see `_load_capture` below, which reds if either
sidecar goes missing.
