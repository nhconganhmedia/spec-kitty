"""Cross-mode dependency edges in lane compute (P2.7).

The original lane planner iterated only ``code_wp_ids`` when computing
``lane_deps``. Planning-artifact WPs were assembled into the canonical
``lane-planning`` lane *afterwards* with ``depends_on_lanes=()``, which
silently dropped two real dependency cases:

1. A code WP declares it depends on a planning-artifact WP (e.g. an
   ADR or research note must exist before code can be written against
   it). Lane(code) should depend_on_lanes = (PLANNING_LANE_ID,).
2. A planning-artifact WP declares it depends on a code WP (e.g. a
   migration runbook is finalised after the migration code lands).
   The planning lane should depend_on_lanes = (lane(code),).

These tests pin both directions of the cross-mode dependency edge.
