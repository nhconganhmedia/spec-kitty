"""Regression: safe_commit must distinguish a genuine empty changeset from a
real commit failure (e.g. a failing pre-commit hook).

Before this fix, ``_run_commit_capture_sha`` collapsed *every* non-zero
``git commit`` exit to ``None`` and ``safe_commit`` raised a single
``"safe_commit: git commit failed"`` RuntimeError for all of them. The commit
router's ``_is_empty_changeset_error`` matched that message by prefix, so a
commit that FAILED for a non-empty reason (a broken pre-commit hook, a rejected
commit, etc.) was silently reported as ``status="unchanged"`` / ``committed=False``
— masking the real failure. This surfaced live as ``spec-commit`` reporting
"Spec artifact(s) unchanged, no commit needed" for a fresh mission whose
pre-commit hook pointed at a since-deleted interpreter.
