"""Shared mocked-environment context manager for CLI command tests.

The CLI surface walks several path resolvers when handling a command:

- ``locate_project_root()`` — write-path resolution (canonical serialization
  pins to the primary checkout regardless of where the operator stands).
- ``get_status_read_root()`` — read-path resolution introduced by WP05
  (mission ``01KRC57C``, GitHub #984) so detached-worktree verification
  reads the current worktree's events instead of the primary checkout's
  potentially-divergent state.
- ``_ensure_target_branch_checked_out()`` — pre-mutation branch guard.
- ``_find_mission_slug()`` — mission-handle resolver.
- ``resolve_workspace_for_wp()`` — execution-workspace resolver for
  per-WP lookups.
- ``get_auto_commit_default()`` — global auto-commit setting.

Tests that exercise these commands against a synthetic ``tmp_path``
mission directory previously each redeclared the patch block. When a new
resolver was added (the WP05 case above), every test file that forgot to
update its patch list silently regressed — the resolver fell through to
the real spec-kitty checkout and the test failed with "Mission directory
not found".

``setup_mocked_env()`` bundles the common patches. When a future
stabilization mission adds another resolver, update ``_DEFAULT_RESOLVERS``
or add another optional parameter here once; every test using the helper
inherits the fix.

Example
-------

```python
from tests.mocked_env import setup_mocked_env

def test_status_warns_for_done_wp_with_rejected_review_artifact(tmp_path):
    feature_dir, wp_file = _build_wp_file(tmp_path, "test-mission", "WP01")
    _seed_wp_event(feature_dir, "WP01", "done")
    _write_review_cycle(wp_file.parent / wp_file.stem, 1, "rejected")

    with setup_mocked_env(
        tmp_path,
        mission_slug="test-mission",
        workspace_resolution=FileNotFoundError,
    ):
        result = runner.invoke(app, ["status", "--mission", "test-mission"])
        assert result.exit_code == 0
        assert "review artifact: verdict=rejected" in result.output
```

    Parameters
    ----------
    tmp_path:
        The pytest ``tmp_path`` fixture (or any prebuilt repo root). All
        default resolvers return this value.
    command_module:
        Dotted module path whose attributes are patched. Different command
        surfaces (``...agent.tasks``, ``...upgrade``, ``...plan``) import
        the resolvers separately, so each test file passes its target
        module here. Defaults to the ``agent tasks`` command module, which
        is by far the most common consumer.
    mission_slug:
        When set, also patches ``_find_mission_slug`` to return this slug.
    target_branch:
        Returned as the second element of
        ``_ensure_target_branch_checked_out``'s tuple. Defaults to ``"main"``.
    workspace_resolution:
        Controls ``resolve_workspace_for_wp``:

        * ``None`` (default) — that helper is left unpatched.
        * Exception class (e.g. ``FileNotFoundError``) — used as
          ``side_effect``.
        * Any other value — used as ``return_value``.

    auto_commit_default:
        When not ``None`` (default ``False``), patches
        ``get_auto_commit_default`` to return this value.
    extra_patches:
        Mapping ``{attr_name: return_value}`` for any one-off resolver this
        test needs patched in the same module. Promote frequently-used
        entries into ``_DEFAULT_RESOLVERS`` rather than re-passing them at
        every call site.

    Yields
    ------
    None — used purely as a context manager.
