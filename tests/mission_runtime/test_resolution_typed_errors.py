"""WP05 typed-error pass-through: MissionSelectorAmbiguous must translate to
ActionContextError at the mission_runtime boundary.

When ``resolve_action_context`` / ``resolve_placement_only`` is called with an
ambiguous mission handle (one that matches more than one mission in the repo),
the underlying ``specify_cli`` exception ``MissionSelectorAmbiguous`` must be
caught at the ``resolution.py`` boundary and re-raised as the single
consumer-facing type ``ActionContextError`` with the specific stable code
``MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR`` — never escaped as a raw ``specify_cli``
exception (FR-005 / #2010 bug #15).

Red-state receipt (pre-fix, unmodified resolution.py):
    The try-block at resolution.py:183 only catches StatusReadPathNotFound.
    When the handle is ambiguous, MissionSelectorAmbiguous propagates up
    uncaught through resolve_action_context, escaping the mission_runtime
    boundary as a raw specify_cli exception. This test asserts that
    ActionContextError is raised with code MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR —
    which FAILS on unmodified code because MissionSelectorAmbiguous escapes
    instead.

Green-state (post-fix):
    The new ``except MissionSelectorAmbiguous`` arm in ``_resolve_mission_slug``
    translates the raw exception to ActionContextError(MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR),
    making the test pass.
