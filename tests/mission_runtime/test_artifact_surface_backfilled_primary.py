"""Regression: ``resolve_artifact_surface`` on a BACKFILLED mission (bare primary dir).

The read-seam migration replaced the lenient ``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission``
leg with ``resolve_planning_read_dir(..., PRIMARY_METADATA)``, which
LITERAL-COMPOSES ``<slug>-<mid8>``. For a **backfilled** mission — primary dir on
disk carries the BARE ``<slug>`` while the coord worktree carries the composed
``<slug>-<mid8>`` — an already-composed handle produced a ``primary_dir`` that does
not exist. ``declared_read_surface`` then found no ``meta.json``, read no topology,
and short-circuited to ``PRIMARY`` before ``probe_coord_state`` ran, so the seam
answered a path that is **not on disk** — a silent wrong answer.

The load-bearing property these tests pin is **idempotence under the seam's own
output**: feeding ``read_dir(kind)`` the canonical name it just produced must return
the same path. The pre-existing ``_build_deleted_coord_mission`` fixtures only ever
build the composed-primary shape, which is exactly why this class slipped through.

Real git repo (``probe_coord_state`` shells out to ``git rev-parse``), hence the
``git_repo`` marker.
