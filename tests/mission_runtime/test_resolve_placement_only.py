"""Unit tests for the WP-less placement projection (WP05, T018).

Mission ``tooling-stability-guard-coherence-01KTRC04`` (FR-003, C-GUARD-3a).

``resolve_placement_only(repo_root, mission_slug)`` is the planning-phase
placement projection: the planning lifecycle (specify / plan / tasks /
finalize-tasks) has no ``wp_id``, so the full :func:`resolve_action_context`
cannot be driven for an :class:`ArtifactPlacementFragment`. These tests pin the
single-authority invariant the catch-22 fix depends on: the projection's
``CommitTarget`` is **byte-identical** to the one the full resolver assembles
for the same mission across all three topologies — flattened (non-protected
target), coordination (declared coordination branch), and protected-main
(target == protected branch).

If the projection ever re-derived a destination independently of the resolver,
this parity would drift — which is exactly the #1784 split-brain it kills.
