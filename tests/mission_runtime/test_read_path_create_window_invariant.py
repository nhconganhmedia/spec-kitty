"""WP06 / T023 — Create-window invariant (SC-005, #1718).

**The invariant (FR-005 / #1718 routing contract):**

  A mission whose primary ``meta.json`` DECLARES a ``coordination_branch`` but
  whose coordination WORKTREE HAS NOT YET BEEN CREATED ON DISK must still
  resolve to the PRIMARY checkout when read with a bare slug — even if the seam
  successfully derives a non-empty ``mid8`` from the declared identity.

  Formally: "a declared-but-unmaterialised coord + bare slug → read resolves
  PRIMARY, regardless of whether mid8 is provable."

**Why this matters (the #1718 trap):**

  The routing function to AVOID is ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor``
  (``coordination.surface_resolver``).  When the coord worktree root is not
  yet on disk, ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`` composes and RETURNS
  the expected coord path anyway (it composes the expected coord path without
  checking for the directory on disk).  A read CLI that mistakenly routed through
  ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`` in the create-window would therefore
  return a non-existent coord path, causing every downstream status read
  (``status.events.jsonl``, ``decisions/index.json``) to fail with a
  "file not found" instead of reading the already-present primary data.

  ``resolve_handle_to_read_path`` is the CORRECT seam: its step 5 delegates to
  ``resolve_mission_read_path``, which selects the coord surface ONLY when the
  coord worktree directory EXISTS on disk.  Deriving a non-empty mid8 is
  ORTHOGONAL to the create-window→primary contract.

**Fixture design (NFR-005):**

  Primary dir name: ``<slug>-<mid8>`` (post-WP03 canonical form).  The seam
  computes the candidate primary path as ``kitty-specs/<slug>-<mid8>`` because
  ``_compose_mission_dir(slug, mid8)`` → ``<slug>-<mid8>``.  The coord worktree
  root (``.worktrees/<slug>-<mid8>-coord/``) is INTENTIONALLY ABSENT so the
  seam falls back to the primary.

  Why the primary dir name carries mid8: ``resolve_handle_to_read_path`` reads
  the bare-slug's meta from ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission(repo_root, handle)``
  = ``kitty-specs/<handle>`` (literal).  Then it derives ``mid8`` and calls
  ``resolve_mission_read_path(repo_root, handle, mid8)``.  Inside that function
  ``_compose_mission_dir(handle, mid8)`` = ``<handle>-<mid8>`` is used to
  build the primary candidate.  So the primary candidate path is
  ``kitty-specs/<bare-slug>-<mid8>/``, which must exist for a successful read.

**Mutation guard structure:**

  1. **Positive contract** — declared-but-unmaterialised coord + bare slug →
     ``resolve_handle_to_read_path`` returns the PRIMARY mission dir.
  2. **Mutation guard** — ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`` returns a
     non-existent (or wrong) path in the create-window, proving that
     substituting it for the correct seam would break the positive-contract test.

def _build_declared_unmaterialised_coord(repo_root: Path) -> tuple[Path, Path]:
    """Create a mission whose primary meta DECLARES a coord branch but the worktree is absent.

    The PRIMARY dir uses the BARE SLUG name (``<slug>``, not ``<slug>-<mid8>``).
    This mirrors the actual create-window: ``mission create`` writes the initial
    spec into ``kitty-specs/<slug>/``.  The coord worktree
    (``.worktrees/<slug>-<mid8>-coord/``) is materialised only on the first
    ``implement`` run, so in the window between create and implement the primary
    IS the canonical read surface.

    The seam ``resolve_handle_to_read_path(repo_root, bare_slug)`` reads:
    1. ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission(repo_root, bare_slug)`` → ``kitty-specs/<slug>``
    2. ``load_meta(primary_dir)`` → the meta with mission_id + mid8 + coordination_branch
    3. ``resolve_declared_mid8(meta, bare_slug)`` → ``_MID8`` (from meta.mid8 field)
    4. M5 fail-closed check: ``mid8 != "" and declares_coordination``
       → raises ``StatusReadPathNotFound`` (because primary declares coord) unless
       the coord worktree ROOT is absent (in which case step 5 handles it).
    5. ``resolve_mission_read_path(repo_root, bare_slug, mid8)``
       → ``_resolve_existing_for_slug`` checks coord root → ABSENT → checks
       primary candidate ``kitty-specs/<slug>-<mid8>`` → ABSENT →
       → ``_canonicalize_handle`` scans index → finds ``kitty-specs/<slug>`` dir
         but its meta slug is ``<slug>`` → priority-3 match → returns it
       → ``_resolve_existing_for_slug(repo_root, "<slug>", "")`` → primary is
         ``kitty-specs/<slug>`` → EXISTS (no coord check since mid8 reverts)

    Actually the simpler path: ``_resolve_existing_for_slug(repo_root, slug, mid8)``:
    - mid8 non-empty → compose coord candidate → absent → not returned
    - primary_candidate = ``kitty-specs/<slug>-<mid8>`` → absent
    - primary declares coord but coord root ABSENT → no fail-closed (coord worktree
      not materialised) → primary_candidate returned (even though absent)

    Then ``resolve_handle_to_read_path`` falls to ``_canonicalize_handle`` which
    finds the real dir ``kitty-specs/<slug>`` (not ``<slug>-<mid8>``) via the
    index (priority-3: slug match), then the existing bare-slug dir is returned
    directly (the backfill path in ``resolve_mission_read_path``).

    Net: ``resolved == kitty-specs/<slug>/`` (the bare-slug primary dir).

    Returns ``(primary_dir, coord_mission_path_that_does_not_exist)``.
