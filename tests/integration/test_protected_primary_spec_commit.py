"""WP07 / T022 + T023 — Non-fakeable e2e + sibling-site coverage (SC-001, FR-001..003, NFR-003).

**Anti-fakeable principle (Renata's review criterion)**

A test that ONLY asserts ``exit_code == 0`` or ``path.exists()`` is fakeable:
a no-op implementation that does nothing still passes it.  The load-bearing
assertions in this file are the NEGATIVE variants — each one stubs
``commit_for_mission`` to a materialiser no-op, verifies that the no-op causes
the positive assertion to FAIL, and thereby proves the positive test cannot
succeed unless the materialiser actually ran.

**T022 — spec-commit entrypoint e2e on a protected primary**

On a ``main``-protected ``ProtectedTargetRepo``:

1. Run the full sanctioned flow through the new ``spec-commit`` entrypoint.
2. Assert:
   - spec.md is ON the ``kitty/mission-<slug>`` coordination branch (not on main).
   - The PRIMARY working tree is CLEAN (no staged/unstaged spec.md changes).
   - ``.worktrees/<slug>-<mid8>-coord/`` was CREATED BY the command (not pre-seeded).
   - ZERO ``SPEC_KITTY_ALLOW_PROTECTED_BRANCH_COMMITS`` usage.
   - ZERO manual git calls bypassing the router.
3. NEGATIVE variant: stub materialiser to a no-op → positive assertions FAIL.

**T023 — 3 sibling-site repros (record-analysis, accept, acceptance)**

Each sibling on a protected primary now materialises-then-retries through
``commit_for_mission``.  All four sites (spec-commit + 3 siblings) share the
same parametrised NEGATIVE fixture so Renata can confirm each is independently
load-bearing.

NFR-003 boundary-read spy is extended to at least one sibling path so a
per-call re-read at ``commit_helpers.py:527`` cannot hide a green result.
