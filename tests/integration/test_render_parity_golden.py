"""SC-004 — event-sourced render parity against a legacy-sourced golden.

Proves "renders from events with no content loss" at the mission level: the
event-sourced render of a WP's ``## Activity Log`` notes, its ``## History``
(lane) rows, and its review-cycle verdict reproduce — byte-equal on the
meaningful content — what a legacy frontmatter/body-sourced render produced.

WP05 re-points the render source (its T019) and WP09 the review render; this is
the mission-level parity guard that those re-points lost nothing.

Two-sided (proof the guard bites): deliberately dropping ONE note / history /
review entry from the event stream turns the golden comparison red.
