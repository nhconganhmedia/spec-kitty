"""RED-first coord-topology proof for the merge risk/dependency gates (#3439).

Mission ``partition-authority-residuals-01M021K9`` — WP02 (US2 / FR-003).

On a coordination-topology mission the merge flow hands
:func:`~specify_cli.policy.merge_gates.evaluate_merge_gates` the STATUS-only
``-coord`` husk as ``feature_dir``. ``lanes.json`` (LANE_STATE) and ``tasks/``
(WORK_PACKAGE_TASK) are PRIMARY-partition kinds that are ABSENT on that husk, so
before the fix:

* the risk gate ``read_lanes_json(feature_dir)`` returned ``None`` → **SKIP**
  (silent safety-gate degradation), and
* the dependency gate ``build_dependency_graph(feature_dir)`` saw an **empty
  graph** → every dependency falsely satisfied → **PASS**.

The fix reroutes both PRIMARY reads through the canonical placement seam
(``placement_seam(repo_root, mission_slug).read_dir(<kind>)``) while KEEPING the
STATUS_STATE event read on the coord husk (C-002). This test drives the REAL
``evaluate_merge_gates`` against the un-stubbed ``git worktree`` coord fixture
(NFR-001): no resolver is patched; the PRIMARY-vs-coord routing decision is
exercised inside production code.

Falsifiability (revert the WP02 reroute → RED):

* coord risk gate: ``PASS`` after → ``SKIP`` before.
* coord dependency gate: ``FAIL`` (real edge, incomplete dep) after → ``PASS``
  (empty graph, falsely satisfied) before.

The flat/single-branch control asserts the reroute is a NO-OP off coord
topology (``feature_dir`` already equals the seam-resolved PRIMARY dir), so its
verdicts are identical before and after the fix.
