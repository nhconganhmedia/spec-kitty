"""Integration tests for intake size-cap enforcement (WP02 T009 / NFR-003).

These tests exercise :func:`specify_cli.intake.scanner.read_brief` and
:func:`read_stdin_capped` end-to-end:

* A 50 MB random file is rejected before being read into memory; peak
  RSS stays below ``1.5 × cap``.
* A 4 MB file is accepted normally.
* A simulated 6 MB STDIN input is rejected without buffering the
  entire payload.
