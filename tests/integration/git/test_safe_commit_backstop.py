"""Integration regression test for the safe_commit data-loss backstop.

Reproduces the sparse-checkout + index-refresh + phantom-deletion cascade
documented in Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty#588, and asserts that the commit-layer
backstop in :func:`safe_commit` aborts the commit before any data is lost.

Tagged ``#588`` so future developers can locate it when they see the cascade
again.

    The real cascade involves a chain of ``git stash`` / ``git stash pop``
    interactions with ``core.sparseCheckout`` + ``skip-worktree`` that
    re-introduce phantom deletions into the staging area between safe_commit's
    ``git add`` call and its ``git commit`` call.

    We reproduce the invariant the backstop must enforce: between the time
    safe_commit has staged the caller's requested file and the time it runs
    ``git commit``, the staging area contains an unexpected path (a phantom
    deletion of an out-of-cone file). The backstop must abort the commit
    BEFORE it is created --- preventing the 243-line phantom reversion that
    hit ``kg-automation`` ``main`` in mission 023.

    We inject the phantom deletion by intercepting ``subprocess.run`` and
    adding an ``update-index --force-remove`` for ``docs/long-runbook.md``
    immediately after safe_commit's ``git add`` step. That simulates the
    exact post-stage / pre-commit state the cascade produces.
