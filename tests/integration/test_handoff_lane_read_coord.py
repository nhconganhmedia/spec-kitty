"""WP04 / FR-006 (#2698): review-handoff per-WP lane reads the coord STATUS surface.

The generated review handoff embeds a per-WP lane (a STATUS_STATE / COORD-partition
kind). Before this fix ``materialize_worktree_topology`` read that lane from the
PRIMARY ``LANE_STATE`` dir, so on a multi-WP coord-topology mission every WP rendered
back as stale ``planned`` — the real (coord) lanes were never consulted.

This is a live, un-stubbed multi-WP coord-topology proof (NFR-001):

* A REAL ``git worktree`` coord husk carries the authoritative
  ``status.events.jsonl`` with WPs in MIXED lanes (WP01 ``in_progress``, WP02
  ``claimed``); the PRIMARY dir carries a stale/empty status log.
* :func:`materialize_worktree_topology` (the production function the handoff
  renderer consumes) must resolve the TRUE per-WP lanes off the coord husk while
  identity / lanes.json / tasks continue to resolve from PRIMARY (C-002).
* The routing is proven LOAD-BEARING by an *executed* revert (monkeypatching the
  seam's ``read_dir(STATUS_STATE)`` projection back to PRIMARY) that flips every
  lane back to stale ``planned`` — the exact pre-fix symptom.

Plus a non-coord control (``flat_topology_mission``): on a flat mission the
STATUS surface IS the primary surface, so the lane read is unchanged.

No resolver is patched to build the fixture — topology routing uses real git +
filesystem state (the shared ``coord_topology_fixture`` helpers).
