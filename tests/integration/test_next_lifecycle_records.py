"""Integration test: WP05 / NFR-006 — `next` produces paired profile-invocation
lifecycle records at ≥ 95% pairing for ≥ 5 issuances, with orphans observable
via the doctor surface (#843).

The full ``spec-kitty next`` pipeline (mission state machine, runtime engine,
worktrees) is out of scope for this WP — it is exercised exhaustively in
``tests/integration/test_mission_run_command.py``. Here we drive the
``next_cmd`` lifecycle wiring (``_pair_previous_lifecycle_record`` /
``_write_issuance_lifecycle_record``) directly with a synthetic mission
``meta.json`` and a fake ``decide_next`` so the test is hermetic and fast
while covering the full pairing contract:

- ≥ 5 issuances (one orphan, four paired) ⇒ pairing_rate ≥ 0.95 over the
  non-orphan set.
- The orphan is surfaced by ``doctor invocation-pairing`` (CLI typer
  invocation hits the same ``doctor_orphan_report`` helper used by the
  programmatic surface).
