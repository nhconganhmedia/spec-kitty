"""WP04 (#676) — Integration tests: counter advances only on real rejections.

Scenario coverage (from WP04, T022):

1. Set up a mission + WP via the existing rejection-cycle fixtures.
2. Drive the WP to ``for_review``.
3. Re-run ``agent action implement`` 2 times → counter unchanged, no new
   ``review-cycle-N.md`` artifact.
4. Trigger a real rejection event (``move-task --to planned`` with a
   ``--review-feedback-file``) → counter advances by exactly 1, exactly one
   new ``review-cycle-N.md`` artifact at the new N.
5. Re-run ``agent action implement`` once more → counter unchanged.

The integration is end-to-end via the CLI Typer app:
``specify_cli.cli.commands.agent.workflow.app`` for implement, and
``specify_cli.cli.commands.agent.tasks._persist_review_feedback`` for the
canonical rejection event (the same helper invoked by the
``move-task --to planned`` CLI surface).

# passes there. Its absence from THIS file, though, left
# ``tests/architectural/test_verdict_name_truthfulness.py::test_flagship_end_to_end_test_asserts_the_non_forced_path``
# red: that gate hardcodes both this file and this exact function name as
# User Story 5's AC2 flagship (see WP16's Activity Log entry, T070) and
# looks it up by exact name at this exact path -- an absence the earlier
# relocation fold did not reconcile against.

# 2026-08 regression-suite exit-rule fold (tests/regression/README.md):
# ``tests/regression/test_issue_2996_approval_after_rejection_writes_no_verdict.py``

# relocated -- this restored copy is the one and only permanent home the
# flagship gate above requires.
#
# WP16 itself already filed the one open naming question here as a cross-WP
# finding it explicitly did not fix: this test's OWN NAME ("writes NO
# verdict artifact") contradicts its own body, which proves the opposite --
# an ordinary, non-forced approve after a genuine rework-and-resubmit cycle
# DOES write a fresh ``approved`` verdict artifact. WP16 did not own this
# file and left the rename to whoever does. That finding still stands and is
# NOT resolved here either: the gate's ``flagship_name`` lookup is a fixed
# string literal in a file this fold does not edit, so any rename away from
# it would trade one red gate for another. Restoring presence under the
# gate's own required name is the fix within that constraint; the
