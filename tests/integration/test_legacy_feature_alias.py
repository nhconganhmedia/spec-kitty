"""FR-035 integration: ``--feature`` is a hidden deprecated alias.

Authority: ``kitty-specs/stability-and-hygiene-hardening-2026-04-01KQ4ARB/spec.md``
section FR-035 and ``research.md`` D16.

The legacy ``--feature`` flag must remain accepted as an alias for
``--mission`` but must NOT appear in any command's ``--help`` output.
The companion contract test
``tests/contract/test_terminology_guards.py::test_no_visible_feature_alias_in_cli_commands``
enforces the static-analysis side; this integration suite pins the
runtime side.

C-001 rationale: ``test_hidden_feature_option_*`` tests and
``test_charter_lint_help_does_not_mention_feature_flag`` were removed
alongside ``_legacy_aliases.hidden_feature_option`` / ``LEGACY_FEATURE_HELP``
(FR-009, WP05 of codebase-sanitization-1060-1622). Those symbols had zero
``src/`` callers; WP02 also removed the ``--feature`` block from
``charter/lint.py``, making the charter-lint snapshot assertion false.
