"""RED-first identity-routing tests on the divergent sentinel-husk fixture (WP01 T009).

Mission ``coord-read-residuals-merge-lanes-and-identity-routing-01KW2M8V`` —
Lane B (#2186). Proves that the routed identity reads resolve their domain value
(lifecycle ``mission_id`` / mission ``type``) from the PRIMARY checkout, not the
STATUS-only ``-coord`` husk, on a fixture whose husk carries a PRESENT-but-WRONG
``meta.json`` (the FR-009 sentinel: ``mission_id = 6KERGF2ZNFBPR91YEZMARG99KS``,
``mission_type = research``) distinct from PRIMARY (``mission_id =
01KW2E7AFC0000000000000001``, ``mission_type = software-dev``).

Each assertion targets a RETURNED DOMAIN VALUE (the written lifecycle record's
``mission_id`` / the mission ``type`` passed to ``get_or_start_run``), NOT a
resolved-path equality and NOT the fixture's ``assert_reads_primary`` /
``assert_both_legs`` path-equality helpers (per T009). Reverting any routed read
to the coord-aware resolver surfaces the sentinel/wrong type → the test goes RED.

**NFR-004 (no primary-dir stub):** these tests drive the REAL helper functions
against a REAL ``git worktree`` coord fixture. No test hands a primary dir
directly to the function under test — the routing decision (PRIMARY vs coord-aware)
is exercised inside production code.

================================================================================
T004 — Lane B (#2186) ROUTE / KEEP / owned-by-implement-loop ownership table
================================================================================

Every Lane B identity site, cross-checked against the implement-loop sibling's
ROUTE+KEEP list and re-resolved against the merged base. No site is left in the
gap between the two missions (FR-005).

| Site (re-resolved on lane-a)                          | Verdict | Coverage |
|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| next_cmd.py `_pair_previous_lifecycle_record`  (~:190)| ROUTE   | this file: test_pairing_* (end-to-end domain value) |
| next_cmd.py `_write_issuance_lifecycle_record` (~:260)| ROUTE   | this file: test_issuance_* (end-to-end domain value) |
| next_cmd.py `_handle_answer` get_mission_type    | ROUTE   | this file: test_answer_flow_type_* (captured type) |
| implement.py `implement` json-output identity (~:1404)| ROUTE   | FR-007 call-shape arm (static): clean post-route; |
|                                                       |         |  shares the next_cmd primary-fold pattern |
| workflow.py sparse-checkout preflight mission_id      | ROUTE   | FR-007 call-shape arm (static) |
| workflow.py get_mission_type leg (own anchor)         | ROUTE   | FR-007 call-shape arm (static) |
| workflow.py review-prompt metadata mission_id         | ROUTE   | FR-007 call-shape arm (static) |
| agent_utils/status.py:132 `show_kanban_status`        | owned by WP03 (T021) — NOT routed here; the FR-007 |
|   identity arm's scope INCLUDES it (statically gated) | identity arm covers its scope but the route lands in WP03 |
| STATUS event-log reads (read_events / status legs)    | KEEP    | coord-aware (C-001) — touching them re-opens #2155 |

The implement-loop sibling's ROUTE+KEEP legs (`workflow.py:2110/2116/2121/2124`,
review-cycle `:2610/:2647`, KEEP `:1015`) are LINE-DISJOINT from the identity legs
above (squad-verified, architect lens) — this WP touches only the #2186 identity
legs, never the implement-loop ROUTE legs (C-009-mirror).

The implement.py/workflow.py sites live inside large orchestration entry points
(`implement()` / workflow `execute`) that require a full mission + worktree to
drive end-to-end; their RED-first behavioral coverage in a focused integration
test is impractical, so their regression coverage here is the FR-007 call-shape
arm (static: verified clean post-route, and the WP03-owned status.py:132 still
flags — proving the arm has live teeth) plus the identical primary-fold pattern
the next_cmd sites prove behaviorally below.
