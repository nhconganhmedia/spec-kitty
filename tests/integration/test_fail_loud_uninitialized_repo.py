"""FR-032 integration: fail-loud uninitialized repo for spec/plan/tasks.

Authority: ``kitty-specs/stability-and-hygiene-hardening-2026-04-01KQ4ARB/spec.md``
section FR-032 and ``research.md`` D14.

The ``specify`` / ``plan`` / ``tasks`` commands must never silently fall
back to a parent or sibling initialized repository when the cwd is not
itself a Spec Kitty project. Symmetric with FR-005's no-silent-fallback
selector stance.

This test exercises :func:`specify_cli.workspace.assert_initialized` --
the helper the three commands call before any side effects -- to assert
the contract end-to-end without spinning up the full Typer app, which is
expensive and orthogonal to the gate.
