"""Atomic-write trial harness (WP02 T010 / NFR-004).

NFR-004: 100 simulated kill-9 mid-write trials must produce 0 partial
files at the target path.  We use ``os.fork()`` + ``os.kill(pid,
SIGKILL)`` so the kill is *not* Python-level — it kills the OS-level
process before any cleanup runs.

The invariant we test is the contract from the WP02 prompt:

    After kill, the target file either does not exist OR is fully
    written and validates against the expected payload.

A "partial file" — ``target`` exists but its contents are anything
other than the full payload — counts as a failure.
