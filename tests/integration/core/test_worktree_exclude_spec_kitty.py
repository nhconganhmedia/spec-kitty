"""Integration tests for WP07 FR-016 per-worktree ``.spec-kitty/`` exclude writer.

Exercises ``_ensure_spec_kitty_exclude`` and the worktree-creation paths that
invoke it, confirming:

* the helper writes ``.spec-kitty/`` to the per-worktree
  ``<git-common-dir>/worktrees/<name>/info/exclude`` file;
* the entry is idempotent (re-invocation never duplicates lines);
* the helper is called from the live worktree-creation path in
  ``create_feature_worktree`` so new lane worktrees benefit without a
  separate opt-in step;
* failures in git probing are swallowed (non-git paths must not raise).
