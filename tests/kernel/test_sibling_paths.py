"""Direct tests for kernel.sibling_paths — the shared sibling-path-resolution
primitive (FR-004, mission doctrine-consumer-surface-missions-extraction-01KZ6G6H).

Before this file the primitive had NO direct test coverage: it was exercised
only transitively through its three callers' own tests
(``kernel.paths.get_package_asset_root``, ``charter.offering.pack_paths._resolve_built_in``,
``charter.offering.missions.repository.MissionTemplateRepository.default_missions_root``).
That gap is exactly why two regressions (a wheel-unresolvable sibling pattern,
and a checkout-root env-var ordering bug) both shipped past review in cycle 1
without a single test catching either — see review-cycle-1.md. This module
tests the primitive itself, isolated from any caller's own pattern choices.

        """The caller-level wheel test for mission #3091's own thesis (WP05).

        Mission ``doctrine-consumer-surface-missions-extraction-01KZ6G6H``
        (FR-005) relocated the missions data from ``src/charter/offering/missions``
        to ``packs/built-in/missions``, falsifying this test's own pre-move
        fixture (a lone data-less ``doctrine/missions`` directory with
        nothing else to find). Uses
        :func:`build_post_relocation_wheel_shaped_site_packages` instead,
        which plants BOTH the real relocated data (``packs/built-in/missions``)
        AND the still-existing, now data-less ``doctrine/missions`` package
        directory side by side -- proving the kernel's own committed
        ``BUILT_IN_PACK_SIBLING_PATTERN`` resolves the real data, not the
        decoy. This test reds if that pattern ever regresses to a bare/
        wildcard ``"missions"`` shape (which would match the data-less decoy
        one ancestor level above this module's own file, before ever reaching
        ``packs/built-in``) -- see ``MissionsRootNotFound``'s docstring.
