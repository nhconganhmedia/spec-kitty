"""Shared corpus builder for the WP03 backfill/verify tests.

Constructs a self-contained mission on disk: ``meta.json``, a ``tasks/WP*.md``
frontmatter carrying the pre-eviction runtime state (``shell_pid`` / ``agent`` /
``assignee`` / ``tracker_refs`` / ``review_artifact_override_*`` / ``history``), a
``tasks.md`` with per-WP checkbox subtasks, and a ``status.events.jsonl`` with the
real ``planned -> claimed -> in_progress`` transitions the claim-anchor derives
from. Both the unit and integration suites import this so the fixture shape lives
in exactly one place.

    events and still flips.

    ``at_encoding`` selects the ISO-8601 UTC designator the seeded transition
    ``at`` values carry (see :data:`AT_ENCODINGS`). Real corpora use both, and
    the seed-ordering seam is encoding-sensitive, so ordering tests parametrise
    over it rather than trusting the ``"offset"`` default.
