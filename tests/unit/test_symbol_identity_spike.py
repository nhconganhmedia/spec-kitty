"""WP06 (IC-WS2-SPIKE) — relocation-proof symbol-identity design spike.

Prototypes and proves (or disproves) two candidate dead-symbol allow-list
keys against real T004 same-name fixtures from ``test_no_dead_symbols.py``,
runs a body-hash stability probe, and records the WP06 carve/continue
decision. See ``tests/architectural/_symbol_identity.py`` for the candidate
implementations and full design rationale; this module is the SPIKE PROOF,
not the gate — ``test_no_dead_symbols.py``'s 343-entry allow-list is
UNTOUCHED by WP06.

CARVE / CONTINUE RECOMMENDATION (T028)
=======================================

**Recommendation: CARVE to standalone #2546.**

Reasoning, evidence-based against the C-004 tripwire ("carve if the key
needs >2 implementation WPs, OR the body-hash proves unstable"):

1. **The body-hash itself is STABLE (T027).** Reusing
   ``anchoring.code_tokens_by_line`` for token normalization, the body-hash is
   provably unaffected by the NFR-001 motion battery (blank-line insertion,
   comment insertion, whitespace reformatting) and by the documented
   3.11<->3.12 f-string re-tokenization (PEP 701) — see
   ``test_code_tokens_by_line_strips_fstring_interpolation_content`` below,
   which exercises the exact same substrate property the existing
   ``composite_key`` ratchets already depend on. This half of the tripwire is
   NOT what forces the carve.

2. **The key design needs a second, structurally-different tier (T026),
   pushing "design" alone past a single WP.** A pure content key —
   ``(bare_name, body_hash)``, CANDIDATE A / :func:`relocation_only_identity`
   — is proven (below) to COLLIDE for the real
   ``charter.offering.directives::ArtifactKind`` / ``charter.offering.procedures::ArtifactKind``
   / ``charter.offering.tactics::ArtifactKind`` fixture trio: all three re-export
   sites contain the byte-identical statement
   ``from charter.offering.artifact_kinds import ArtifactKind``, so their local
   definition-site text cannot distinguish them by content alone. Sanctioning
   any one of the three under CANDIDATE A silently sanctions all three —
   reproducing the exact T004 re-blinding bare-name-alone was banned to
   prevent, via a different route. Restoring correctness requires CANDIDATE B
   / :func:`hybrid_identity` (adds a module-path tiebreak) — but that
   surrenders genuine cross-file relocation tolerance for precisely this
   fan-out subset, which is also FR-008's explicitly-named exemption category
   ("docstring/``__all__``-only re-export decomposition shims"). A real
   design would need BOTH tiers plus a rule for *when* to escalate from A to
   B — that is design work beyond a key-swap, before any migration starts.

3. **A third structural shape exists that neither candidate can even locate.**
   ``specify_cli.runtime::ResolutionResult`` / ``ResolutionTier`` are exposed
   via a lazy ``__getattr__`` facade dict (``_EXPORT_MODULES``), not an
   AST-visible name binding at all — :func:`definition_span` correctly
   returns ``None`` for it (proven below). A real implementation needs a
   THIRD detector path (dict-literal-value resolution) on top of the two
   already required by finding 2.

4. **WP-count arithmetic hits the tripwire.** Design (points 2+3, a two-tier
   key plus a facade-dict detector — already more than "prototype a key")
   is WP1; the 343-entry bulk migration (untouched by this WP, per the
   isolation rule) is WP2; FR-008's auto-derived exempt-category / module
   detectors (registry migrations, re-export shims, Typer sub-apps) are WP3.
   That is 3 implementation WPs for the *minimum* correct design — at the
   C-004 threshold's boundary, and the fan-out/facade findings above show the
   real count is likely to grow past 3 once edge cases (multi-target
   ``ImportFrom``, conditional/``TYPE_CHECKING``-guarded re-exports,
   decorator-carrying class bodies) are handled for all ~343 entries.

**Net**: the tripwire's "unstable body-hash" branch is NOT hit, but the
"key needs >2 implementation WPs" branch IS — CARVE, ship WS1+WS3 now, seed
#2546 with this spike's findings (candidate A/B split, the facade-dict gap,
and the concrete fan-out fixtures below as its regression corpus).
