"""CLI-backed integration tests for mission system (per-feature model v0.8.0+).

Tests mission_list/current/info use the 0.x MissionConfig schema.
On 2.x, mission files use v1 State Machine DSL format which MissionConfig
cannot parse. The switch/blocked tests still work on 2.x (they test error paths).
