"""WP10 / NFR-001: flattened/single-branch mission regression — behavior neutral.

The gate-read-surface mission re-partitioned planning reads onto the PRIMARY
surface for coord-topology missions. For a FLATTENED mission (no coordination
branch) there is no primary↔coord split: BOTH partitions must resolve the single
``target_branch`` feature dir — IDENTICAL to pre-mission behavior. This module
pins that neutrality across every gate-command read kind so the coord-topology
fix cannot silently change the flattened path.

Both the PRIMARY-partition reads (spec / tasks / WP-task / lane-state) and the
STATUS-partition reads (status-state / acceptance-matrix / analysis-report)
resolve the same flattened feature dir, and the real entry points
(``collect_feature_summary``, the write twin) behave as before. Identity is
production-shaped (26-char ULID, composed ``<slug>-<mid8>`` on-disk dir).
